<p class="center">SOME REVIEWS OF THE FRENCH EDITION</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Emile Faguet</span> in <i>Les Annales Politiques et Littéraires</i>, March 5,
1916:—</p>

<p>I had the honour … three years ago to write the Preface to
M. Gaston Riou’s first book, <i>Aux écoutes de la France qui vient</i>. It was
full of fire, impetus, and passion; it was a heart-beat. I was not always
of the same opinion as the author, but I never failed to share his sentiments.
I felt in him at once a brother in patriotism and a brother in love
of truth and justice. I greeted him affectionately and contradicted him
tenderly. You all know the success of the work. The public learned
and has remembered a new proper name. M. Gaston Riou now presents
us with a very different book, but one painfully entrancing, as its title
implies, <i>Journal d’un simple soldat, guerre—captivité, 1914-1915</i>.…
M. Riou now shows himself to be an extraordinarily delicate and lively
painter of real life, a charming painter of landscape, a vivacious narrator,
a thoughtful, conscientious, and penetrating psychologist alike in respect of
individuals and of nations. At once artist and thinker, the artist never does
injustice to the thinker, while the thinker always gives the artist free play.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Chicago Daily News</i>, May 1916:—</p>

<p>Out of the mass of books, good, bad, and indifferent, which have been
written about the great war, there is one, <i>Journal d’un simple soldat</i>,
by Gaston Riou, which stands out as a work that will live and pass
down to future generations as a masterpiece.</p>

<p class="hanging">Rev. <span class="smcap">Father Ménage</span>, O.P., in <i>La Revue des Jeunes</i>, Feb. 25, 1916:—</p>

<p>The author of these pages is a man of energy and self-command.
But he is something more. What gives the work a distinctive character
is the profundity of its psychologic sense.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Daily Chronicle</i>, March 24, 1916:—</p>

<p>It has grown out of the war, but it is more than a war book because
it has thought, feeling, knowledge, and English readers of French will
appreciate its great charm of style.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">A. Billy</span> in <i>Paris Midi</i>, Feb. 9, 1916:—</p>

<p>These pages are the diary of the man who, among all the French
prisoners, was perhaps best fitted to understand Germany from within.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>La Tribuna</i>, Feb. 20, 1916:—</p>

<p>Though not a novel, it is as engrossing as a novel.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Daniel Lesueur</span> in <i>La Renaissance</i>, March 18, 1916:—</p>

<p>Every one should read this record of imprisonment, whose realism—simple,
trivial, and at times almost repulsive—is irradiated with a beauty
which no work of romantic fiction can ever equal.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Marcel Rouff</span> in <i>Mercure de France</i>, April 1, 1916:—</p>

<p>The book will gain by being read and re-read after the war, when the
coming of peace will have restored to us that independence of mind which
is necessary for the adequate appreciation of works of art.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Paul Bourget</span> in <i>Echo de Paris</i>, April 28, 1916:—</p>

<p>I consider the <i>Journal d’un simple soldat</i>, one of the best examples of
the literature of war impressions which has characterized the conflict now
in progress.… The book is as impassioned as a novel and as living as
history.</p>

<h2>BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE</h2>

<p><i>Gaston Riou was born on January 7, 1883. He is a native of
the Cévennes, the region from which are derived three of the most
distinguished among modern French psychologists, Melchior de
Vogüé, Auguste Sabatier, and Paul Bourget. The Cévenole family
from which he springs played an active part in the wars of
religion. On the mother’s side he is related to Jacques de Vaucanson,
the leading French mechanical engineer of the eighteenth
century, and also to Majal Désubas, the last Huguenot martyr,
executed at Montpellier in 1747. Thus by family tradition he is
liberal, nonconformist, and republican.</i></p>

<p><i>Propagandist by temperament, he devoted himself at an early
age to the study of Christian origins. In 1905, at the Sorbonne,
he wrote a thesis upon the <span class="antiqua">De unitate</span> of St. Cyprian. His first
published writings dealt with the modernist movement of Loisy,
Murri, and Tyrrell, and they attracted considerable attention in
Italy and in Germany. The ardour which inspired them was very
different from the <span class="antiqua">rabies theologica</span>. The young author, though
Calvinist by conviction, adopted an attitude remote from partisanship,
his view being, “Whatever is Christian, is ours.” He insisted
upon the need for a new synthesis, embracing at once the ancient
faith and the actual conditions and the social life and thought of
our day. He contended that the non-Roman churches scattered
throughout the world might well constitute the embryo of a new
Catholicism. But above all, in this writer simultaneously republican
and Christian believer, was manifest the earnest desire to
reconcile the France of ’89 with the Christian ideal and the longing
to witness and to assist in the renovation of his country. Writing
of him at this period, M. Emile Faguet, a noted French critic,
declared: “His ardour, his fire, his impetus, the rush of his blood,
are all instinct with the passion of patriotism.”</i></p>

<p><i>In the year 1913 this admixture of religious uneasiness and
nationalist hope found expression in a volume entitled <span class="antiqua">Aux
écoutes de la France qui vient</span>, which from the first attracted
widespread attention. Above all, this work embodies faith in
France, and the leaders among the younger men of the country
rallied round him who had ventured to proclaim this faith. M.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
Jean Finot, editor of the <span class="antiqua">Revue des Revues</span>, bestowed upon
Gaston Riou the title of <span class="antiqua">princeps juventutis</span>. Since then, with
the coming of the war, all France has regarded the <span class="antiqua">Ecoutes</span>
as a work of prophecy. We read in it the phrase: “Silently
and studiously an élite is in process of formation. The members
of this élite are united, as it were, in heroic friendship, for
they are all animated by a single passion, the desire to renovate
their country, and they are all inspired by the same faith, simple
and strong. When others despaired, they did not despair. They
are confident that a splendid morrow, worthy of the finest epochs of
our history, is now germinating in the furrows of our motherland.”</i></p>

<p><i>Nor was it in France alone that <span class="antiqua">Aux écoutes de la France qui
vient</span> attracted attention. In Germany, Karl Lamprecht, the great
pangermanist historian, devoted two lectures to it at the royal
court of Dresden. In <span class="antiqua">Zukunft</span> Maximilian Harden exclaimed:
“The publication of such a work suffices to prove that je-m’enfichisme
[the Gallio spirit] is dead in France, and that young
France is turning away from the scepticism of the masters of
French literature.”</i></p>

<p><i>Riou collaborated with Bergson, Henri Poincaré, and Charles
Gide in the publication of a historical study, <span class="antiqua">Le matérialisme
actuel</span>, an attempt to summarize the tendencies of contemporary
thought. Of this volume a critic declared: “For France it celebrates
the close of the age of negativism, and heralds the opening
of an epoch of lyrical effort, of affirmation, and of activity.”</i></p>

<p><i>When war broke out, Gaston Riou had just returned from a
journey in England, Scotland, and Wales. He went to the front
among the first, took part in the fighting in Lorraine, and was
mentioned in dispatches. He was wounded in the battle of Dieuze,
was taken prisoner, and passed eleven months in a Bavarian
fortress. This was not his first visit to Germany. A year
earlier he had been sent there on an official mission, and he is
personally acquainted with many Germans of note.</i></p>

<p><i>The fruit of his imprisonment is <span class="antiqua">Journal d’un simple soldat</span>,
which we are now publishing as <span class="antiqua">The Diary of a French Private</span>.
In its native land the success of the book has been extraordinary,
and the sternest of French critics have with one voice declared it
to be a permanent addition to literature. Paul Bourget, Emile
Faguet, Camille Mauclair, and Maurice Donnay all speak of it as
a masterpiece.</i></p>

<h1>THE DIARY OF A FRENCH PRIVATE</h1>

<h2 id="REMINISCENCES_OF_A_PREVIOUS">REMINISCENCES OF A PREVIOUS
JOURNEY</h2>

<p class="right"><i>September 2, 1914.</i></p>

<p>Here I am a prisoner.</p>

<p>What a journey! I am bitter at soul; it makes me
sick to think of it. Across Rhenish Prussia, the Palatinate,
the grand duchy of Baden, Würtemberg, and
Bavaria, for three days and three nights, at every
station, and even as we pass through the countryside,
groups of peasants and gloomy crowds of citizens
hurl execrations at us, stamp, and shake their
fists, making signs that they would like to cut our
throats and tear out our eyes. From the streets of
country towns, lost amid the sweltering plains, troops
of children assemble, waving flags. They form up
in line beside the track. When the train comes in,
moving slowly like a funeral convoy, they beg for
our képis; they vociferate in their own language,
“Paris <i>kaput</i>! Death to the French!” The sight of
the red cross armlet produces paroxysms of fury.
“Death,” they scream, “death to the red cross men!
These are they who finish off our wounded!” The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
shouting becomes strident, terrible, mad. Sometimes
they try to take the train by storm, and are stopped
only by the bayonets of the German soldiers on guard
in each compartment, who growl out threats.</p>

<p>The women are even more horrible than the men.
The murderous glance, the clawed fingers, working and
tearing as if in the dream of a tigress, the nostrils dilated
and twitching, the lips cyanosed, grimacing hatred—never
before have I seen such faces of damned souls,
such Medusa heads. Who could believe that women
should appear so horrible!… When the train
stops for any time, richly dressed matrons parade beside
it, offering our guards mugs of beer, cigars and cigarettes,
bread-and-butter and jam, steaming sausages. Sick
with hunger and fatigue, we look on at this prodigality.
“Above all,” they say, “give nothing to these French!
Let them starve!” We are offered water.</p>

<p>Everywhere, at the stations, from the steeples, the
factories, the inns, huge flags are waving. Chime
answers chime across the rivers. The big cathedral
bells make the hills re-echo. All Germany is holiday-making,
drunk with blood, thrilling with the prospect
of victory.</p>

<p>Is this the Germany I knew last year?</p>

<p>I had travelled through the country in the company
of Marcel Chabrières, as if on a pilgrimage. We passed
through Heidelberg, my peaceful Heidelberg, so lovable
in the shade of its august ruin and of its oak-crowned
and vine-clad hill; Marburg, the quiet little town with
its professors and its workmen, resting more quietly at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
the foot of the margrave’s castle than even the bones of
St. Elisabeth of Hungary beneath the pavement of the
church; Dresden, that fine seat of artistic and courtly
life; Munich, the Teuton Florence, blooming like a
flower; Weimar, more sacred than all the others, where
the neighbouring houses of Schiller and Goethe mourn
discreetly the memories of the golden century, the lyrical
and generous youth of Germany!… We were charmed
with these laughing cities of the spirit. I can still picture
them in the limpid air of last spring, I recall their dainty
aspect, and the cheerful welcome they accorded us; I
see their waters reflecting the blue skies and the bright
clouds. When I but think of them, in this damp crypt
of exile, gusts of liberty, youth, and ecstasy agitate my
heart.</p>

<p>We had strolled through the docks of Cologne and of
Hamburg; we had visited Elberfeld, Barmen, Hagen,
and Essen, the smoky iron-towns of Westphalia. Near
the great forges of M. Krupp von Bohlen we had admired
the fairylike village of Margaritendorf, where brutal
modern industry would seem to have pledged itself to
put its slaves to sleep every evening in an idyllic retreat.
From the window of the train, on the journey from
Hamburg to Berlin, passing through a country of pines
and lean fields, we had a glimpse of Friedrichsruhe, the
lordly domain where sleeps the “honest broker” who
made the empire, “awaiting the resurrection of the just.”</p>

<p>After the gentle sweetness of the ancient university
towns, we were intoxicated with the energies of this
new world, this world of pride and of money, of sweat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
and of lucre. Even in ugly Berlin, the parvenu town, we
paid our respects to the titanic effort of a nation in the
full vigour of life, ambitious, stubborn, determined to
dazzle the world, to take the place of Athens, of Rome,
of Paris, convinced of its destiny to rule the universe.</p>

<p class="tb">But every one talked to me of peace.</p>

<p>Since I was upon an official mission, I was able to
converse with the men in whom young Germany recognizes
its masters. They all spoke with one voice.
They declared that their race had an ecumenical
mission. Patriotic, active, prolific, it was inevitably
destined to control Europe. “But for this,” they added,
“we need peace.”</p>

<p>“Why, then, are you armed?”</p>

<p>“We have no natural frontiers; our plains lie open
to the invader both from the east and from the west.
English merchants are jealous of our successes; France
obstinately refuses to grasp the proffered hand of friendship;
Russia is becoming panslavist. Caught in such a
vice, how can we ensure peace in any other way than
by arming for defence? But we have no need of war.
In twenty years we shall be eighty millions, and we
shall be rich. Do you imagine that it will then be
necessary for us to unsheathe the sword in order to play
our proper part in the world?”</p>

<p>This was the language employed to me by liberals.
It was the language of M. Simon and M. Wolf, editors
or owners of the two leading journals in Germany; of
Max Weber of Heidelberg, the keenest intelligence I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
have ever known; of Troeltsch, the distinguished
sociologist; of Windelband, the successor of Kant and
of Fichte; of Vossler of Munich, the Romance philologist,
rival of such men as Ferdinand Bruneau and
Joseph Bédier; of Liebermann, the celebrated Berlin
painter, who has supplemented the labours of Paul
Cassirer in order to introduce the work of our impressionists
into Prussia; of Lichtwark, the director of the
Kunsthalle in Hamburg; of Naumann, the editor of
<i>Hilfe</i>, who supplies ideas to men of the left wing in
politics; above all, of a man more influential than any I
have yet named, Carl Lamprecht, the Saxon, whose
gigantic history of modern Germany has taken the form
of an epic in honour of William II.</p>

<p class="tb">Young men, who across the Rhine are “liberals,”<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
talked in just the same way.</p>

<p>I shall long remember the night we passed at
Frankfort in the company of M. Moritz von Bethmann,
cousin of the Chancellor. How ardent was his
confidence! He was far from being a malcontent.
He had no desire for any kind of “restoration”; and
still less did he wish, in the name of a Frederick
Barbarossa or of a Frederick the Great, to anathematize
the present. He accepted it joyously,
delighted to be living in it, eager to carry his full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
share of duties and hopes. But his lightness of heart
was neither studied nor ostentatious.</p>

<p>I recall very precisely his reply to the charge of
materialism which, on the spur of the moment, I
levelled against new Germany. His rejoinder was
spirited and instantaneous.</p>

<p>“Do you really believe,” he said, “that we are
going to rest satisfied for a long time in the boastful
materialism that ensued upon the victory? You dare
to say this, at the very moment when Kant and
Fichte are once more being restored to honour; when,
just like you, we are discovering the ‘buried temple,’
internal values, faith! Allow me to assure you that
the young men of Germany are at this moment more
exacting in matters of spiritual nourishment than
your young men of the Agathon type and the group
that runs the <i>Action française</i>. Our minds cannot
give themselves up to a stupid or politic adoration
of that which our intelligence, fully conscious of its
work, has destroyed. Though it may cost us more
suffering than you, we demand that our hearts and
our minds shall preserve full freedom of judgment,
and we know how to await their decision. We are
not prepared, under pretext of spiritual nostalgia, to
accept outworn formulas which would compel us to
shun and to disavow the social order we owe
to science, history, commerce, and democracy. We
shall not give ourselves up to the cult of any religions
which, however venerable they may be, are
surcharged with fossilized rubbish and proud of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
their state of petrifaction, which would have no understanding
of our scruples, and would be absolutely
unfitted to fecundate our real life!</p>

<p>“I do not know if the renascence in France takes
the form of swearing by the middle ages, or by the
seventeenth century, or by Bonald and de Maistre,
and of invoking maledictions on the work of ’89.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>…
The German renascence, if this be so, is at the
antipodes of yours. But do not imagine that we are
iconoclasts. As much as any others, we like to come
to terms with tradition. But we insist that tradition
shall not hinder our freedom of movement, that it
shall either make us live or let us live. Is that
vaingloriousness? When we claim the privilege of
living, of thinking, and of creating, no less freely than
did the men who founded the tradition of the middle
ages, or than those who founded the tradition of the
seventeenth century, are we not within our strict
rights, and is not the exercise of these rights a positive
duty? We may be wrong, but we believe that a
new world is in course of construction. The work
that has to be done is of greater value in our eyes
than the work that is finished, however venerable and
august the latter.</p>

<p>“I am a close student of your new political literature.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Will you permit me to say that I discover
therein a carping and regretful tone? It seems to
me that its chief effort is devoted to blackening and
decrying the regime you have chosen, to undermining
confidence in it. Our efforts take the opposite direction.
We are all for construction, adaptation, glorification,
lyric enthusiasm. We accept our national
mission. We accept our present life. We desire that
our energies should continue to increase, to coalesce,
to become intertwined. You will see; when the
right moment comes they will secure for us a
hegemony, and beyond question it will be the most
humane and the most pacific of hegemonies.”</p>

<p>Our conversation was a lengthy one. All the conventional
barriers had been cast down. Every one
gave utterance to his own truth, as if speaking to
himself alone, in that species of lucid exaltation which
sometimes results from a prolonged vigil. And the
strange thing was that in proportion as behind the
verbal agreements we sensed ever more strongly
the depths of unexpressed antagonisms, we felt each
for the other an increasing esteem. The hours
passed. All the lamps in the Frankfurter Hof had
been extinguished, except our own, which continued
to burn in the great reading-room, its yellow light
piercing the smoke-wreaths from our cigars, and exhibiting
the virile and yet refined features of the
young banker. We passed out into the open. The
porter was asleep. The streets were deserted. After
this great duel between our respective national<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
dreams, the cold of the night was agreeable.
Through the ancient street where the young Goethe,
locked up by his father in the corner room, had
watched Gretchen going by, we gained the banks
of the Main. The first streaks of dawn were already
illuminating the broad surface of the river, peopled
with motionless vessels.</p>

<p>This was a year ago. Now the war has come
between our dreams.</p>

<p class="tb">I remember this as if it were yesterday.</p>

<p>At Leipzig, again, I see a small and cheap room,
an eyrie in the Inselstrasse, among the great printing
houses. It was attractive none the less, almost
touching in its simplicity, the ugly little place, with
an empty cup of coffee on the edge of a deal table
laden with papers, and, fixed to the wall, two
shelves for books. It was a cell, showing that its
tenant was a man devoid of all vanities, a stranger
to the amenities of our century. Here, one fine
morning, after I had rung the bell five or six times,
I was welcomed by M. Wilhelm Baum, editor of <i>Die
Akademische Rundschau</i> and president of the “Free
Students.”</p>

<p>Mlle. Marianne Lamprecht had drawn my attention
to this young man as a sort of <i>princeps juventutis</i>.
Her father thought highly of him and assisted him
in his undertakings. The society of which he was
the leader had ramifications throughout lettered and
scientific Germany. All its members were serious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
workers; its mere existence had overwhelmed with
ridicule the reputation of the old aristocratic “corps,”
those little courts of idlers, where the gilded youth of
the fatherland, under the pretence of study, spends all
its days in drinking, duelling, and drabbing.</p>

<p>The appearance of M. Wilhelm Baum surprised me.
Over his night-shirt he had hastily donned a short and
seedy jacket; his hair was untidy; he was a small
man of awkward aspect. The cinders from the stove,
scattered here and there, scrunched under our feet.
My eye was caught by the teaspoon, still wet, among
the manuscripts. The man was in keeping with his
surroundings. Yet, when I had seated myself on an
ancient sofa with broken springs, my second glance
at this “prince” aroused sympathetic feelings. A
secret flame illumined the blue eyes, the ascetic brow,
and the sickly countenance, revealing, in this shy
youth of twenty-five, a strong and lofty soul.</p>

<p>He, likewise, confided to me his hopes.</p>

<p>They differed little from those of M. Moritz von
Bethmann. But on the lips of M. Baum they received
an apostolic breadth. The young banker had not
shown that he felt any insurmountable horror of war,
which he regarded merely as a useless expense.
M. Baum, on the other hand, whose entire mentality
was under the influence of evangelical radicalism,
detested war as barbarism and as a manifestation of
antichrist.</p>

<p>At one o’clock, since I could not make up my mind
to leave him, I persuaded him to dine with me at my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
hotel. Marcel Chabrières had spent the morning at
the museum among the tinted marbles of Max
Klinger. He was astonished to find that I was
already on a friendly footing, almost intimate indeed,
with this young German.</p>

<p>Enthusiasm is the bread of youth. Youth loves
the impossible, and will accept life only through a
passion which colours it with iridescent hues, invests
it with a halo, and endows it with heroic lineaments.
This meal was one of those moments of transfiguration
when the world seems malleable and impregnated
with divine fire. Our minds were filled with a vision,
the vision of a new classic age, as harmonious as the
age of Pericles in Greece or as the third Christian
century, but vaster, richer, more humane, sparkling
with youth—an age which was to integrate and
beautify the conquests and discoveries, still uncoordinated,
of the last three hundred years. German
and French, in this dream, came to an understanding.
It is true that he considered that his nation, turning
back to the tradition of Weimar, was to be the
master-craftsman, whereas I contended that France
had never ceased to occupy that role, which was her
vocation and fulfilled her nature. But this difficulty
seemed trifling. We were not so much antagonists
as friendly rivals.</p>

<p>Is this man, I asked myself when he had gone,
is this man typical of young and literate Germany?
In the classic land of militarism, is it only the old
who are swashbucklers?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>A few weeks later, in early spring, on one of those
afternoons in which showers alternate with sunshine,
and in which the buds, swelling with sap, open, I was
walking in the beech forest to the south of Munich.
My companion, about thirty years of age, was in fine
fettle. Tall and thick-set, florid of face, hair blond
and bristly, he walked like a conqueror, and seemed
in his element among these sturdy trees. The man
of the woods personified! I considered that this professor,
already renowned, ought rightly in appearance
to be rough-hewn, massive, dynamic, like a woodman
at work. He was a hearty eater and a vigorous
drinker, ruddy with health, absolutely innocent of the
scepticism of drawing-rooms. I had several times
before had the chance of admiring this man who
reminded me of one of our Normandy horses. Above
all, I had seen him at the Hofbrauerie in Munich,
where we had washed down our political discussions
with copious draughts of that dark beer, whose consumption
in Bavaria is encouraged by old King Louis,
chief brewer, and owner of the wealthiest tavern in the
empire.</p>

<p>A country walk frequently encourages avowals which
would never have been made during a thousand meetings
in town, among sophisticated men. My companion
had just confessed to me that he belonged to the
“Social Democracy.” As yet in secret only, for it is
not permissible in Germany to wear openly and simultaneously
the livery of the professor and that of the
socialist. But the socialist party, suffering from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
dearth of intellectuals, desired him to become a
deputy. At the first opportunity, he would exchange
his professorial chair for a seat in the Reichstag. The
ambition to revive Bebel in his own person, to become
a new Wilhelm Liebknecht, made his nostrils dilate.</p>

<p>Somewhat mockingly, when with the impetuosity of
primitive man he was speaking of the social mission
of Germany, I said to him point-blank: “Admit that
you think we are worn out, that in your eyes France
is nothing more than an elderly beauty, with bald
head, pallid lips, wrinkled skin, decayed teeth, enfeebled
intelligence!”</p>

<p>“If I were a bourgeois,” he answered laughingly,
“I should answer in the negative. You still have your
stockings and your bankers, matters of considerable
importance in the eyes of the bourgeoisie of every land.
But I am a socialist and a democrat. The minimum
programme of our party is to effect the overthrow of
Prussian absolutism, and to apply throughout Germany
that parliamentary regime which is the <i>conditio sine qua
non</i> of all social advance. But you French, for your
part, hold this parliamentary regime in scorn. What
would you have me think of a nation which repents
of its virtues, which makes fun of its chief glory?</p>

<p>“Here in Germany we read your Maurras and similar
writers.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> We are told that in France these men have
the ear of the younger generation. It astounds us. It
seems to us insane, this cheerful renunciation of the
tradition which has made you famous, and for which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
you are still idolized by all that is noblest in the world.
Do you find this strange? When material force is
failing you, you, the noble nation, become rabid apologists
of the regime of force, of ‘the man with the
big stick.’ You take Machiavel for master. You ask
for a French Bismarck. You declare yourselves to be
royalists, imperialists, absolutists. I can see no difference
between your romano-positive young men and
our own <i>echten Deutschen</i>, those energumens who deafen
us in our public squares with their <i>hochs</i> to the Kaiser,
who shout their <i>Deutschland über alles</i> at every <i>prosit</i>,
and who pile monument upon monument in honour
of the militarist Moloch, until the appearance of our
towns becomes intolerable. Young Frenchmen converted
to the Germany of the junkers, blood-brothers
of our idiot of a crown prince! What a farce! But
for us, the German socialists, this is merely an additional
reason for the redoubling of our energies. Our
watchword to-day is extremely simple: to raise in
Europe and to carry onward to victory the standard
of democracy which has fallen from the hand of
France!”</p>

<p>“Such is really your idea of France, your own, and
that of all the German left?”</p>

<p>“To speak frankly, it is with us a dogma that
generous and humane France is dead, and that all
that was best in her spirit has entered into us.”</p>

<p>We walked on for some time without saying a word.
The idea never occurred to him that these wholesale
judgments could possibly shock or pain me, for he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
one of those happy men, common in Germany, endowed
with a veritable talent for frankness. He continued his
terrible strides, and after a while he exclaimed gaily:
“Anyhow, you don’t bring enough children into the
world to be socialists. Our ideas can germinate only
in dense crowds, where there is hardly standing room,
where people lack air and space, breed without restriction,
and have nothing to lose! Your <i>Einzweikindersystem</i><a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
condemns you to be nothing but bourgeois, and
poor bourgeois at that!”</p>

<p>I made no answer. What answer was possible?
He knew my ideas. He had been one of those who
introduced my <i>Ecoutes</i> into Germany. Besides, it gave
him so much pleasure to believe in our decadence, to
be convinced that Germany, as far as democracy was
concerned, was henceforward without peer in the world.</p>

<p>Indeed it is true, all these “young men of the left”
were ardent believers in Germany’s mission. But to
justify this mission they did not, like the cynical pangermanists,
appeal to the <i>Faustrecht</i>, the right of the
stronger; they did not speak of bloody conquests.
Perhaps they thought of them, but such brutalities
(which the German mind, even when finely tempered,
accepts with little reluctance) remained hidden in the
background, within the domain of possibilities, among
the lesser evils and contingencies—profane delights
which a platonic lover hardly dares to envisage even
in his secret dreams. Idealists of the Michelet type,
quaffing the austere wines of Kant and Fichte (recently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
unsealed and served round at the universities by the
new masters), they made an exclusive claim to the
moral heritage of ’89, of which we, they said, had
ceased to be the heirs. Were not they the youthful
neophytes of the democratic faith which the degenerate
French had lost? Had they not passionately espoused
the modern world, whose uncertain dawn had first ventured
to shine on Paris, that slight and foolish city, but
whose full noon was now to illumine the strong and
loyal (<i>treu und fest</i>) town of Berlin, the guardian of the
Rhine? Yes, <i>finis Galliæ</i>! It was theirs to lead the
great caravan of the universe towards the new justice.
It was their part, the part of these good Teutons, with
their virgin spirit and their new blood, to direct in future
the affairs of the human race. <i>Gesta Dei per Germanos!</i></p>

<p class="tb">One of these young men was M. Wichert, director of
the Mannheim museum. He was the favourite disciple
of M. Lichtwark of Hamburg, and had also been a
pupil of the late celebrated von Tschudi, grand master
of the artistic life of Germany. Von Tschudi, it may
be mentioned in passing, of course had a quarrel with
William II, just like Bismarck, just like Haeseler, and
Bülow, just like all the clever men in the empire who
were unfortunate enough to possess a vigorous individuality.
M. Wichert was a friend of our consul,
M. Deschars,<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> who arranged a meeting between us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>Son of a poor officer, and orphaned while quite
young, M. Wichert went through his course of studies
as best he could. His life is a romance. Loneliness;
poverty; chance encounter with a Mæcenas; sudden
abandonment of science for art; renewed poverty;
unexpected patronage by the great pontiffs of art,
Tschudi and Lichtwark; appointment as sub-director
of the picture gallery of Munich; appearance upon the
scene of the Magian kings, a delegation of aldermen
from the town of Mannheim, modernist before all,
offering him carte blanche for the creation of a museum;
for a start the young Messiah purchases in Paris
Manet’s best work, “The Execution of Maximilian,”
Daumier’s portrait of Michelet, and the “Man with
the Pipe,” the most famous of Cézanne’s pictures; all
Mannheim is terrified at its commissioner’s prodigality;
he defends himself before the entire town council,
silencing some by his boldness, winning over others
by his disinterested violence, by the aspect of his
threadbare coat, and the thinness of his slight but
ardent figure; thus he arouses that municipal patriotism
which is so keen in the fatherland, convincing the
councillors that he will do nothing less than make
of Mannheim the leading art centre of Germany, and at
the point of the bayonet he wrests from them a vote of
confidence; shortly afterwards, a wealthy Jew entrusts
him with five million marks for the establishment of
a museum; he founds an art school to enlighten the
Mannheim bourgeoisie, which is upstart, elementary,
but open-minded and full of goodwill; his lectures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
become fashionable in the town; he provides similar
instruction for the common people; acting upon suggestions
made by M. Osthaus, a rich bourgeois of Hagen,
he establishes travelling exhibitions. In a word,
Tschudi being dead and Lichtwark dying, M. Wichert
allowed his own way at Mannheim, at twenty-five
years of age figures in the role of co-ordinator, protector,
inspirer of the artistic life of Germany. He has
made up his mind to transform Mannheim—the Hanseatic
city of traders and manufacturers, the mushroom
town flaming red with its abundance of new bricks, an
American city suddenly appearing in Europe—into a
Jerusalem of the new art. He desires that the streets
shall become beautiful, that their names shall have a
poetic ring, that the squares shall be as harmonious as a
house by Van de Velde or Niemeyer. He secures an
order for the demolition of the theatre built ten years
earlier in the “Jugend” style, and already an object of
ridicule; a competition is opened for the design of the
building which is to replace it. The whole town
becomes crazy about art. A bourgeois is regarded
as dishonoured if he has not given 40,000 marks to the
museum to buy a Renoir or some Gauguins. If this
apostolate continues, the people will checkmate the
very Athenians.</p>

<p>M. Wichert talks to me in the following strain: “In
the history of art nothing can rival the creative energy
displayed by France. Romanesque, gothic, all the
gothics, renaissance, baroque, rococo (the terms have
no invidious meaning in Germany), directoire, empire—all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
these are French. Throughout ten centuries you
continued to bring forth styles which were so elegant
and so convenient, whose taste was so confident, that
they instantly captured the world.</p>

<p>“But have you suddenly become sterile? Is France,
pre-eminently the nation of innovators, no longer competent
to do anything but to copy its own past? Like
your new sociologists, your furniture makers supply
Louis XVI, Louis XIV, empire; your builders furnish
Louis XVI, renaissance, and again Louis XVI. Have
you really ceased to produce architects since Gabriel
and Louis, cabinet-makers since Boule, enchasers since
Gouthière? Or is it that you no longer care for anything
but the old, like those respectable and fatigued
ladies who cannot endure a new face, and ask only to
be allowed to die in peace, surrounded by the things of
their youth? However this may be, we often tell one
another that France no longer possesses enough energy
to survive the titanic act of giving birth to the modern
world, and that she is now nothing more than a
beautiful corpse, embalmed and laid to rest in a
splendid museum.</p>

<p>“Here in Germany, believe me, we worship your
artistic tradition. For centuries we could find nothing
better to do than attempt to assimilate it. You have
visited Cassel, Pilnitz, Carlsruhe, Potsdam; I cannot
doubt that you felt at home in these royal palaces,
which are nothing but replicas of Versailles.</p>

<p>“But I sometimes incline to think that the creative
force which formerly existed in France has emigrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
to Germany. It is true that during the nineteenth
century there occurred in France a splendid blossoming
of sculptors and painters: Delacroix, Rude, Carpeaux,
the landscape painters of Barbizon, the admirable
school of Manet, and, coming down to to-day, Rodin,
Degas, Maillol, Jouve, Vallette, the expressionists.
Yes, unquestionably, even if your architecture (the
master art which controls and co-ordinates all the rest)
is decadent, your sculpture and your painting remain
unrivalled.</p>

<p>“But are you not struck by the fact that during the
last twenty years it has been in Germany, above all, that
your innovators have gained appreciation; that many of
them have had to secure their first celebrity in the
foreign world, before they were enabled to harvest in
France the fruits of a restricted glory, admired in their
own homes solely by a group of cosmopolitan epicures?
Are you not astonished that such a man as Van de
Velde, who vegetated in Paris, should build palaces for
our great manufacturers; and that Maillol, the sculptor,
a most typical Frenchman, should find a place of
honour in our museums while in France he is still
almost unknown? Is this neglect deliberate? Is it
because you are convinced that genius cannot flower
to perfection until it has suffered, that you provide this
chill atmosphere for your best artists? Or is it timidity,
unwillingness to take risks, stupidity, provincialism?
Whatever the reason, the air of France is to-day less
favourable to creation than the air of Germany.</p>

<p>“In Germany there is an extensive public which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
lives upon the hope of a new ‘culture.’ This public has
nothing in common with the pangermanists. It includes
few generals and few leaders of the bureaucracy.
But it contains our best men of letters and some of our
principal bourgeois, in a word, the general staff of
wealthy, liberal, and parliamentary young Germany.
There are some, like Stephan Georg, Wolfskehl, and
Madame Osthaus, in whom this hope assumes an
ardent and mystical character, becoming a true
religion. While it is the fashion in Paris, at least so
we are assured, to be frankly reactionary,<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> here all the
men and all the women who wield the empire of mind
are animated by a quasi-messianic spirit. Is it possible
that Nietzsche, with his idea of the revaluation of
values, has contributed to the spread of this spirit? I
do not know. We wait; we aspire; we hope. To us
to-morrow is sacred. Every one is striving towards
forms of life and art which shall be more ample, more
truthful, more expressive, more beautiful. Every one is
making ready to welcome the wonderful butterfly which
is to spring from this larval age. It is with us a matter
of faith that the men will come, that they are now on
the way, who can provide the artillery and the watchwords
of the new civilization.</p>

<p>“I frequently visit Paris to attend the great sales; I
am well acquainted with the superior smiles with which
many of your critics greet our attempts. They make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
fun of the curved outlines of our ‘Jugend’ buildings.
For my part, I detest that style of architecture as much
as they. Are we not now demolishing a theatre built
after this design, although the mortar is hardly dry?
But it is possible for us to destroy our architectural
abortions. In Germany you can get money, all the
money you require, for an artistic purpose. Can you
do the same in France? Can you make sacrifices to an
ideal incorporated in stone? No, you have too little
faith. You believe in your bankers, not in your artists.
You venture nothing in art; we hazard all, boldly
running the risk of making a mistake. And, by
building, we learn to build.</p>

<p>“Ten years ago we were making bad attempts;
to-day we have discovered a system of architecture
appropriate to modern requirements and at the same
time beautiful. Go and look at the Weltheim in
Berlin, M. Osthaus’s home at Hagen, the new station
at Hamburg. When you are in Hamburg get M.
Schumacher, chief architect of the republic, to show
you the plans of the magnificent public garden he has
just designed, which is to cost fifteen million marks.</p>

<p>“Here money is the ally of art, the living art of
to-day, the ally of artistic creation, whereas in your
country money, more prudent, devotes itself only to the
purchase of antique and catalogued beauty. I believe,
in fact, that France lacks Medicis, whilst Germany
possesses them in abundance. The reason is obvious.
The wealthier members of our bourgeoisie are uneasy
and discontented; they desire a true parliament which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
will enable them to get the better of the junkers; it is
their nature to be progressive. Your bourgeoisie, on
the other hand, has triumphed, and, since it has nothing
more to desire, it is natural that it should dread novelty
in philosophy and art no less than in politics. I know
that what I am saying runs counter to all your hopes.
But you can do nothing to change your destiny in this
matter. France has entered the conservative phase;
we are now the creators; we, henceforward, shall be the
true successors of your masters.”</p>

<p class="tb">Thus everywhere was to be heard the same refrain:
the future lies in the hands of Germany! Germany
is the Messiah of the new art; the Messiah of the
socialist city; the Messiah of modern thought; the
Messiah of the new classic age. She is the successor of
aged France. It is she who will realize what the
last of the great Frenchmen have dreamed.</p>

<p>In all these young men, the élite of the German
nation, there was effervescing a strange force, there was
surging an ardent and emotional nationalism, a
veritable religion of German primacy. They considered
that primacy inevitable. It originated spontaneously;
its increase was dependent upon organic growth; and
no accident, whether in war or peace, could either
hasten or hinder it. They were all radiating hope;
they all had faith in the present, a warm vintage
yielding a thick and heady must, of intoxicating
aroma, and whence will be derived a robust wine for
the peoples to drink.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>They were sincere when they spoke of peace.
Doubtless their idealist ambition was transformed
into a materialist and brutal ambition among men
of business, officers, and bureaucrats. For these latter,
German production was to ruin that of England, the
German will was to control the foreign chancelleries.
But such ends cannot be secured without war.</p>

<p>Or they could be secured without war, only if Europe
made up her mind to submit! Only if the English
merchants were good enough to go bankrupt! Only
if the greater Slavs should offer no objection to
the enslavement of their little brothers on the Drina!
Thus while the young liberals were dreaming of
a pacific hegemony, Krupp was making his 420
millimetre guns, sergeants were teaching recruits to
fear their officers as they feared God, and Berlin was
fashioning new military laws which even the socialists,
after some formal resistance, voted integrally.</p>

<p>But during this journey, the fact which struck me
most of all was the existence of a liberal youth. I had
not expected to find anything of the kind. I had been
so positive that from the Rhine to the Vistula I should
hear nothing but the noise of military accoutrements.</p>

<p class="tb">I had seen the German army in Strasburg, at the
<i>Parole Aufgabe</i> in the Place de Broglie, when the
general transmits to the officers’ corps the orders and
the passwords. The whole of this assembly, in its
light-grey uniform in which a simple sub-lieutenant
was indistinguishable from a colonel, made salutes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
The salute seemed to me the distinctive sign of this
army, a fervent salute, involving the head and the
entire spine, passing off in a smile at once triumphant
and humble, martial and innocent, seeming to say,
“How enviable I am in that I obey! How enviable
I am in that I command!”</p>

<p>I looked down on this from the third story of
the editorial offices of <i>Le Journal d’Alsace-Lorraine</i>.
Suddenly I came to understand the feudal spirit,
the cascade of absolute authority and of submission
which formerly descended from the sovereign to the
serf by way of the hierarchy of barons.</p>

<p>When I had crossed the Rhine, in the streets of the
German towns the strength of this impression grew,
until it became positively haunting. Everywhere I
saw blind adoration of the uniform, overwhelming joy
in wearing it; everywhere the intoxication of command,
equalled only by the delight of obedience;
everywhere complete ignorance of the essential equality
of men, demonstrated first of all in the life of Christ,
and which, once it is thoroughly understood, purifies
politeness of servility, transforms obedience into
affectionate collaboration, and transfigures power into
service; everywhere, both in military and in civil life,
I saw lords and servants, I saw the same man at once
lord and servant, lord of those under him, servant
of those over him—but nowhere did I see citizens. I
saw servants, submissive, prepared for anything,
obedient to every sign, mechanized and rejoicing
thereat, convinced that it was to their interest to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
be so, proud of the shape and strength of the iron
hand of which individually each man was one of
the innumerable phalanges. I was tempted to see
in this the dominant characteristic of the German
nation. A powerful nation, but one estranged from
the modern spirit: a medieval islet in the midst of
liberal Europe; a redoubtable nation wherein
absolutism, exorcised elsewhere in ’89, was patiently
preparing its revenge, and whence some day, perhaps
soon, would come the initiative of a combat to the
death between feudalism and democracy.</p>

<p>Some weeks after the scene in the Place de Broglie,
M. von Arnim, attached to the Prussian general staff,
accompanied me through the barracks of Potsdam and
the camp of Döberitz. The regiments of the guard
were at drill. The order, the silence, were absolute,
even in the case of those standing at ease. The drill
ground was nothing but a vast solitude, like those great
electric power works, which appear deserted, and
where the only sign of life is the gentle hum of
the dynamos. There seemed nothing human in this
drill ground. From time to time there was a raucous
cry, and the gloomy maniples advanced, retired,
wheeled to the right or to the left.</p>

<p>“What a fine army of automata!” I said under my
breath.</p>

<p>“That’s it,” exclaimed M. von Arnim, grasping at
the comment, which had been made for my own
edification alone, as a eulogium. “In France you
cultivate individual initiative, but we avoid it like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
pest. The whole aim of our training is to break it
down. All we need is to produce somnambulists,
performing such and such an action upon such and
such an order; not reflecting, not reacting, but acting
merely, passively, by instinct, responding to the order
as a well-trained thoroughbred responds to the pressure
of your knee. The soldier must not think. Above
all he must not think. If we attribute so much
importance to the rigorous carrying out of movements,
if we push to the point of mania our fondness for these
drill-ground evolutions which you regard as useless and
ridiculous, it is because they break down thought, rout
it, weary it, put it to sleep, and annihilate it; because
they reduce the human being to the level of a pure
automaton. Show me a man who, by persistent
drilling, has been emptied of thought, and I will show
you a good soldier!</p>

<p>“On the battlefield, automatic obedience and fear
of the superior officer take the place of courage. This
doctrine has but one inconvenience: we shall sacrifice
more men than you when we have to attack. This
is of no consequence. We have less reason than
France to make a thrifty use of our soldiers. Germany
is prolific.”</p>

<p class="tb">This German army, what a powerful mould it would
constitute for a healthy race, one filled with the pride
of youth but still requiring to be formed, one which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
not yet emerged from the simple gregarious stage,
one without any of those dispersed indurations due
to the appearance of irreducible individualities—a race
still boneless and plastic.</p>

<p>I know not whether it was due to my actual
experiences, or simply to French prejudice, but I came
to doubt the reality of German liberalism, and to
regard as isolated and uprooted exceptions those young
men in whose company I had recently breathed the
pure air of democracy.</p>

<p>No, I said to myself at this time, the German nation
sets no value upon civil liberty; its Protestantism is
mere window-dressing; its Reformation, in contradistinction
to that of Calvin, was solely the work of
its princes (<i>cujus regio hujus religio</i>); if there were any
logic in events, the Germans ought to be Roman
Catholics, whilst we ought to be members of the
reformed church and modernists; Catholicism flourishes,
and socialism is so successful, in Germany, only
because both the one and the other correspond to
a general need for regimentation and tutelage, furnishing
an equivalent for military discipline to all those who
come forth from barrack life. I noted, in fact, that
German socialism had nothing in common with our
own; that it did not represent the proletariat at all;
that it was a sort of sub-bourgeoisie, comfortable,
well-off, placid, and lacking that revolutionary fervour
which arises from an outraged conscience; that it
constituted a bureaucracy, a hierarchy, a church
based upon Marxist dogma; and that it owed its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
unbroken unity to the complete absence of thought
and passion among its members.</p>

<p>At such times it seemed to me that the Prussian
army was precisely suited to the German nation,
desirous, not of self-respect, but of material well-being,
friendly to that which controlled it, a people loving
to be led. Yes, I said, such a nation needs such an
army. And how fond the people is of the army.
The bourgeois look upon it with fatuous affection.
The kinglets of the empire are all eager to Prussianize
themselves within the framework of this army;
they all long to secure high command for themselves,
if possible to become army inspectors, considering that
the red band confers as much distinction as their
crowns. I even went so far as to tax with duplicity
the liberals of the great commercial and manufacturing
world, comparing them to some territorial chief, who in
outward aspect was pious and good-mannered, but who
in an out-of-the-way court of his castle kept a number
of hungry bears, prepared to loose them, as a final argument,
upon any one who ventured to annoy him. At
Dresden I had received a letter from M. Lichtwark,
containing the following phrase: “The two finest
types of modern man are the English gentleman and
the German officer.” It is too plain, I exclaimed,
Germany worships her army; Germany worships
herself in her army; the army is Germany; the
army dominates the entire country, just as the colossal
figure of stone which commemorates the iron chancellor
dominates with its huge symbolic sword the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
port of Hamburg and the forest of masts in the
Elbe!</p>

<p>This doubt concerning the future of my young
liberals returned periodically to sadden me. It was
like an intermittent fever.</p>

<p>Was it possible to believe that they had the remotest
chances of success, the Teuton Vergniauds who thought
of renewing, after the lapse of a century, the adventure
of the constituent assembly? Had they any clear
idea of the terrible power of absolutism incarnate in
the junkers and in the Prussian officers? These had
no resemblance whatever to our eighteenth-century
seigneurs, light-hearted, winning, generous, and philosophic—such
men as Noailles, d’Aiguillon, and Montmorency,
who spontaneously despoiled themselves on
the 4th of August. I foresaw that it would be crushed
without pity, this liberal impulse, so fragile even in its
strength, the instant it transcended the sphere of art
and letters.</p>

<p>“Give us ten years,” the Munich socialist frequently
said. “By that time the crown prince of Bavaria, who
is a liberal, will have become king; the Prussian electoral
system, the Bastille of the autocracy, will have
been destroyed. But if we fail in Prussia, we shall have
done with legal methods, and our watchword will be
<i>Vive la Révolution</i>! For the death of William II will
mean the regime of the sabre.”</p>

<p>“Ten years,” I rejoined, “is a long time in an epoch
of tense and threatening rivalries. Are you not afraid
that before this period comes to an end fear of democracy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
ambition, and economic needs may force your
government to declare war against us?</p>

<p>“You will all be famous soldiers of the Kaiser, should
that happen, you good liberals and socialists. You
imagine yourselves opposed to militarism. But, without
knowing it, you are its best resource, its great
accomplice. You are such ardent patriots. You have
so fanatical a belief in the destiny of Germany. How
trifling is the difference between you and the pangermanists.
You desire hegemony without war; they
desire it at all costs, even if they have to fight for it.
What does this distinction matter? It will be so easy,
when the right moment comes, to befool you. It will be
so easy for the wolf to appear in sheep’s clothing; to
masquerade as a victim; to pretend that Germany has
been invaded; to give to a war of aggression and conquest
the sacred aspect of a war of national defence!</p>

<p>“Let us suppose that, through ill-luck, the war ends
in a German success. Good-bye, then, to your dreams,
to European idealism, to democratic dogmas. Great
will be the discomfiture of your Tugendbund. The
days of the Holy Alliance will return. When peace
comes under these conditions your ‘borns,’ on their
manorial estates, will luxuriate in the pious certitude
that they are essentially different from the ‘not-borns,’
and that God has predestined them to be masters and
leaders of men, just as, in the beginning, He created the
white elephant and the royal tiger. Then, perhaps, in
our defeat, we shall regretfully recall Sembat’s formula,
<i>Faites un roi, sinon faites la paix</i>; then we shall hail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Maurras as a prophet; inspired with a sense of renewed
virtue, we shall mock at the civic dream which was our
chief glory; and we shall fill the world, again become
feudal, with the clamour of our repentance. A fine
spectacle indeed would be such a repudiation by
France of the great vision of fraternal justice with
which she intoxicated the nations. What will you do
in those days, you German democrats, when the mother
of all democracy is vanquished, when the only disinterested
champion of your ideal has perished at your
hands?</p>

<p>“But you may rest easy in your minds, for we have
no intention of dying. We have agreed to three
years’ military service. We should agree, if needs must,
to four years or to five. And do not, for this reason,
accuse us of militarism. Our militarism is the militarism
of Valmy. Full well do you know that we
have no hidden thoughts of aggression or oppression.
When we consented to the increase of our army, it
was doubtless with a sincere desire to witness the
overthrow of the barbarism of the kaisers and the
crown princes, but we have never ceased to be faithful
to the revolutionary watchword: ‘Let us vote for war
upon the tyrants and for peace with the peoples!’”</p>

<p class="tb">The socialist of Munich, Wichert, the president of
the <i>Freistudenten</i>, Moritz von Bethmann—how far
away does it all seem now. They have killed; we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
have killed. Their glances full of youth and intelligence,
which, when I was a free traveller, I received
frankly, face to face, man to man; our conversations;
our blossoming friendship; our common hope; the
ideal, dear to Nietzsche, of the “good European”—what
fragile things you are, beautiful creations of the
mind!</p>

<p>Shivering on the cement floor of the casemate during
the first night of my imprisonment here, I was continually
haunted by the faces of my German friends.
They did not smile at me as of old. Their eyes flashed.
They glared at me like hawks. They pierced me; they
wounded me. I was sad, sick at heart. How difficult
it is to endure hatred. I seemed to hear bells ringing
in my empty head. And always I seemed to see my
friends’ eyes, strangely transformed, harsh, greedy eyes
burning with ambition, cruel, the eyes of treasure-hunters,
such as one sees on the friezes of Susa in
the beast faces of the Assyrian kings with long
perfumed beards.</p>

<p>Here I squat in a corner of this crypt, hungry,
thirsty, stupefied, my brain inert, lacking energy to do
anything, looking on at my own adventures as if they
were those of a stranger. Images of my experiences
in the campaign, in which I seemed to have suffered
fatigues beyond the limits of the credible, pass idly and
almost indifferently through my mind. Already I seem
to regard these experiences with indifference, like those
military descriptions in Cæsar or Sallust, which no
longer stir any one’s emotions. I am aware of nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
but my body. It seems strange to a man who believed
himself to live upon ideas, to be reduced to become
nothing but a stomach. I thought of Rabelais this
morning, of Gargantua surrendering himself to his
pleasures, of Frère Jean des Entommeures “wetting
his whistle.” My imagination wallowed in the sensuous
delights, in the gigantic satisfactions of appetite,
with which the four books abound. One needs to
be positively starving to appreciate to the full the
groaning boards of the monk of Chinon.</p>

<p class="tb">Our division had been sacrificed beforehand.
Charged, I imagine, to protect the retreat, it had
held firm. How, and for how long? A private in
modern warfare knows nothing. This much, at least,
is certain, that the division was wiped out. The battle
moved away from us. The sound of the cannonade
became more remote. Suddenly there ensued an
intense calm. Of the horrible struggle, with the
noise of which my ears were still ringing, there
remained no sign beyond the abominable stench of
the bodies now beginning to putrefy in the fallows
and the vineyards beside the forest of Bride, and from
time to time, rising from the deserted hollows, the prolonged
and lamentable cries of the wounded who had
been abandoned.</p>

<p>At Kerprich, in the district of Dieuze, in annexed
Lorraine, I passed my first week of captivity.</p>

<p>What a week! Among the rear-guard of the German
army which flowed on like a river, dropping with sleep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
and weariness, again and again aimed at by the patrols,
by day and by night I carted human flesh. Dead, and
more dead, dead men of all sorts, those who had been
killed instantly in the heat of action, those who had
bled to death from their wounds, men who, after being
wounded, had been finished off by the scouts, had been
shot at close range when they were asking for water or
were endeavouring to keep themselves alive by eating
lucerne; then there were the half dead, men shot
through the head, men whose chests had been
riddled; men shot through the groin. When I
looked at these disfigured and groaning masses of
flesh, it seemed to me as if my nerves were being
scraped. The rest of the wounded found their way
in unaided, running, limping, dragging themselves
along, helping themselves with a stick, crawling on
all fours. It was appalling. I saw an infantryman
who had been shot through the chest and who had
walked alone for a league, holding a white flag. He
had lost almost all the blood in his body. I do not
know by what miraculous strength of will he kept
going. When he reached the field hospital he said:
“I waited four days for some one to come. I am
thirsty. I feel better, but I am thirsty.” He smiled.
He was beautiful, this young man, like a waxen St.
Sebastian. Then, without a word more, he fell dead.</p>

<p>I had been assigned to the tent where those most
dangerously wounded were brought. There were about
forty of them, upon a thin layer of straw, and some even
on the bare ground. The place swarmed with flies, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
it stank of dejecta and of dead bodies. When the sun
was high, the heat was stifling. In the evening, the
patients’ teeth chattered with cold. Some of them were
lads of the 20th corps, men with the colours when the
war broke out, all Parisians, of simple and engaging
courage, and able to take an interest in their bedfellows.
There were men from Provence, the pain of whose
wounds forced tears from their eyes, and who confided
to me their amours as they might have done to a sister.
When the pain was at its worst, they all cried out:
“Maman!” It was heartrending.</p>

<p>I tended them. By day and by night, a thousand
times I ministered to their needs. There were but two
basins for seven hundred and twenty wounded. I made
part of a shell serve me for a third. I watched the
dying; I gave what consolation I could; I buried the
dead. Always guarded by two Pomeranian soldiers, I
went through the village begging soup for the poor
lads. The inhabitants were utterly terrorized. Some
of the women, one of them lame and one but a girl of
twelve, astonished me by their persistent kindness.
Under the eyes of the Germans as they were, the ardour
they displayed, simply Christian in character, was truly
heroic. Often, however, I had to make up for the lack
of rations by a gay speech, overflowing with hope.
Continually it was necessary to remake the straw pillows
under the heads of the wounded, to rearrange their
bedding, to help them to move. Always, beneath the
low canvas roof, was to be heard the same orchestra of
cries, hollow sighs, death rattles, and lamentations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Occasionally, during the long, cold night, lacking
strength to carry the body of some comrade who had
just died all the way across the meadow to the burial
pit, dropping the dead man, I would fall beside him and
go to sleep there.</p>

<p>On the 20th, when our field hospital was already in
fair order, a Prussian captain came by with his company.
He stopped, commandeered the horse of our surgeon-in-chief,
M. Bergé, and promptly mounted it. Then, in
grating and sonorous French, he called out: “Fear
nothing, wounded. I know that in your newspapers—I
read them, the <i>Figaro</i>, the <i>Temps</i>—they term us barbarians.
We are not barbarians. For my part, I bear
a French name; I am the descendant of French refugees.
My name is Charles de Beaulieu. I swear to you that
you will be well cared for in Germany. Germany
respects the red cross.”</p>

<p>At noon on the 28th, having sent away those fit for
transport and also those unfit, having performed a last
amputation, and having buried the rest of the dead, we
set out, with empty stomachs. What was our destination?
The innocents, of whom I was one, had no doubt
that we should be sent back to France by way of
Switzerland. The others, those who had seen the
wounded being finished off, especially the wounded
officers, declared: “The German military authorities
are unrelenting, even though the rankers are good
fellows. The patrols who finished off the officers and
some of the sergeant-majors were acting on strict orders.
If they had been inspired by personal ill-feeling, do you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
think it likely that they would give coffee and brandy
to the wounded as they do often enough? Would they
stop to tend them? It is the high command which is
responsible for this base practice. Do you think those
who set so little store upon the lives of the wounded
will respect the red cross?”</p>

<p>Thus it was that, while we were on our way to Dieuze,
carefully escorted, the members of our little troop were
debating the question: “Are we merely detained for a
time, or are we prisoners?” At Dieuze we were marched
round the town. This was not necessary in order to
reach the railway station, and our capture hardly seemed
to afford adequate ground for a triumphal procession.
But it was evidently considered desirable to show us
off to the inhabitants, who made no sign.</p>

<p>A week earlier, when we had entered Dieuze as conquerors,
the shopkeepers had filled our pockets with
chocolate and sweetmeats; the publicans had given us
free drinks. “Above all,” said the people of Dieuze in
plain terms, “take care that they never set foot here
again!” Wishing for a French-German dictionary, I
begged a townsman to get me one. “I don’t use the
article,” he said; “I know no German.” He called his
daughter and she brought me her own dictionary.
“Pay yourself,” I said, offering her my purse. “Oh,
monsieur,” she answered, “I could not take money from
a French soldier!” On the sideboard there stood a
goblet, and she filled it for me with Moselle.</p>

<p>Throughout the little Lorraine town there was the
lively commotion of a feast day. The army and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
populace were exchanging cheerful brotherly greetings.
This delight at seeing one another again seemed so
natural. Night fell. The weather was clear and warm.
The noise of firing reached us from the vine-clad hills.
The regiments were drawn up in line of battle in the
streets. A hundred yards from the houses, behind the
stooks, a French battery was shooting towards Vargaville.
Having walked out to this battery, I enjoyed the
only sight of beauty I had during my campaign.</p>

<p>In the calm air, the smoke plumes of the German
shrapnel looked like fireworks. Near by, one of our
regiments, spread out like a fan, was advancing through
the oats. The men had spent the night in the barracks
of the light horse. Further on, in the stubble and the
green fields, under a rain of shells, the Alpinists were at
work with their rifles, in cheerful mood. In good order
they mounted the northern slope of the smiling basin
between Dieuze and Vargaville. It looked like one of
Van der Meulen’s pictures. The sun was setting. The
perfumed air was filled with shafts of light. After each
discharge, the song of the birds and the humming of the
insects was audible. Then, the limbers having been
attached, the battery went off at the trot to another
position.</p>

<p>On the 28th, on the contrary, Dieuze was like a city
of the dead. No one appeared at the windows. Huge
flags, celebrating the fall of Manonviller, had been
hoisted by German orders. There was a gloomy silence,
like that of a deserted inn, like that of Paris at four in the
morning; but instead of the carts of the market gardeners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
and of the dustmen, there were heaps of empty
knapsacks, broken rifles, rags soiled with blood and
clay, which had been carted in from the battlefield.
We marched quickly, keeping the French step, so that
our guards were out of breath. Grey-clad regiments
passed us without a word. When our progress was
arrested by a number of forage wagons filled with
wounded, a tall Prussian colonel, on horseback, wearing
an eyeglass, accosted us in French, saying: “Fous n’afez
pas honte, fous la témocratie française, d’être les alliés
des Russes, ces Parpares?”<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Not one of us made
answer. We did not even look at him. He sat there
motionless. However, showing him my armlet, I inquired,
“Are we detained, or are we prisoners?”</p>

<p>“Prisoners! You fire on our field hospitals!”</p>

<p>“Allow me to say, monsieur, that I do not believe it.”
Then we resumed our march.</p>

<p>The station; the long wait; the block of carts filled
with wounded; a light cavalryman on foot, with bandaged
head, advancing towards us, hatred in his eyes,
threatening us with his revolver; the search of our
knapsacks; the confiscation of our maps, knives, forks,
razors, punches—everything which could be used for
cutting or piercing. Then we entrained.</p>

<p>I am so foolish as to believe in the good faith of
humanity. It seemed to me incredible that a civilized
nation would not respect the red cross. “Unquestionably,”
I said, “they will send us to Switzerland.”—“We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
shall see,” answered Riffard, “whether our journey leads
us southwards.” Were we going south? This was the
great question in dispute. Every one looked at his
watch and examined the position of the sun. Since the
railway line made zigzags, running sometimes to the
south and sometimes to the north, we became divided
into two camps, the “southerners” and the “northerners,”
the light of heart and the foreboders of evil. At times
the dispute between the two factions waxed lively.</p>

<p>After a run northward, the train passed through
Bensdorf, and at nightfall we found ourselves in the
great station of Strasburg. There we were ordered to
get out. We were shut up in a room on the landing,
below the level of the railway, giving on the street.
Through the grated door the passers-by gazed in on us.
I was kept awake by the cold and my recent memories
of the town. After some hours came the order
<i>Vorwärts</i>, and a fresh entrainment. What was our
destination? The first glimmer of dawn showed us the
green hills of Alsace covered with plum-trees. Alas,
we were going northward. Saargemünd. Rhenish
Prussia. Saarbrück. Oh, Saarbrück! What a reception
we had from the women of Saarbrück! My ears
still tingle with their execrations. Then came the
Palatinate, then Philippsburg. Good-bye to hope! I
did not see the Rhine, for we crossed it in the middle
of the night, and I was sleeping on the floor between
the seats.</p>

<p>It was obvious when we awoke that we were going
down hill. We crossed the duchy of Baden, traversed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Würtemberg by way of Stuttgart and the Swabian Jura,
with its green valleys, its woods, and its sparkling rivulets;
at length, after crossing monotonous plains, at the
bottom of a hill we reached Ulm, nestling on the Danube
beneath its graceful Gothic cathedral. Our halt was
made at Neu-Ulm, the first town we came to in Bavaria,
and a town which I shall never forget, for it was there
that we made the second meal of our journey. It consisted
of a bowl of vermicelli soup in which a gobbet of
meat was swimming. The previous day, at Zweibrücken
(otherwise known as Deux-Ponts), we had been given a
slice of <i>Leberwurst</i>. This pittance seemed heavenly to
us, for we were starving after a three days’ fast. Be
blessed among all the towns of Germany, Neu-Ulm and
Zweibrücken!</p>

<p>For the third time since our departure from Dieuze
night fell. The train continued its journey, and its
direction was now south-south-east. The southern
faction was on the increase, and the wind was setting
in the direction of hope. In the course of an animated
discussion, rendered lively by hunger and by the
doubts which Guido expressed as to the likeliness of
our liberation, I fell asleep. At two o’clock in the
morning the train stopped. I did not wake up.
Abbé Guido, tough and rugged like the mountain district
in which he toiled, one of those peasant priests
who wed the church with fanatical asperity, just as
they would have wedded their land, Guido was not
asleep. He was sitting all of a heap in the corner
of the carriage, wearing his képi wrong side before,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
smoking cigarettes. From time to time the sardonic
fold of his lips was rendered yet more bitter by
a sigh as he said: “Ah! vidasse! qué vidasse!”<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
He must have given vent to the apostrophe, which
showed his utter weariness of life, twenty times at
least, when, morning having come, I awakened to the
sound of this malediction.</p>

<p>It was an oppressive day. The sun was fierce; the
sky leaden, without soul, without life. In the carriage
it was stifling.</p>

<p>“Where are we?”</p>

<p>“At Ingolstadt.”</p>

<p>Ingolstadt! The “forty propositions,” Luther,
Father Eck, the celebrated attempt to unite the two
churches, the great “disputations” of the sixteenth
century. But the sight of the bayonets of the
Bavarian guard on the platform dispersed my train
of reminiscences.</p>

<p>My stomach was complaining loudly. We were
told that the stop was for six hours. The sergeant
of the guard assured us that we were to be sent to
Switzerland. Then a medical officer, thick-lipped and
hook-nosed, with small, laughing eyes, a man who
waddled continually with a sort of conceited good-nature,
passed through the carriage, and said in a
nasal accent: “Pas te malades? Pas te fièvres tes
gôlônies?”<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> This Judaico-Swabian French revived
our spirits. But the gnawing in our stomachs continued.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Would they not give us a slice of <i>Wurst</i> or
a plate of soup with a gobbet of meat in it? But
they brought us nothing. The six hours had passed.
The midday heat made the blood boil in our veins.</p>

<p>It happened but yesterday, and yet it has aged me
by a century. I say it without hatred, without the
shadow of a desire for vengeance. Under the ancien
régime the crowd was amenable without restriction
to talliage and to the corvée; now that it reigns, the
crowd is gullible without restriction; it is nothing
better than an unstable puff of vapour at the mercy
of the winds. My heart is filled with pity for the
crowd.</p>

<p>“Where are we going?” I asked of the <i>Feldwebel</i><a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
in command of the detachment.</p>

<p>“To Fort Orff, two leagues from here, towards the
north. You will find there a thousand of your
compatriots.”</p>

<p>“Are you keeping the men of the red cross as
prisoners?”</p>

<p>“So it seems. I can’t understand it. At Fort
Orff there are certainly quite a hundred <i>Sanitäter</i>.”</p>

<p>“These are fine spoil!”</p>

<p>This <i>Feldwebel</i> was a tall, ruddy young man, trim
of figure, gentle and shy. His name, he told me, was
Conrad Kilian, and he was a schoolmaster from Upper
Franconia. He stationed me at the rear of the column,
beside himself, to act as interpreter. He was greatly
concerned about those of my comrades who were too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
obviously exhausted. “How on earth will they be
able to walk uphill for ten kilometres?” This impotent
kindness of heart was touching. The setting
sun cast its rosy light over the Danube and the ancient
city, bristling with church spires and surrounded by
Gothic walls with massive towers. We passed through
it under a deluge of cries of “Death!” And what a
litany of <i>kaputs</i>!<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> “Paris <i>kaput</i>! Manonviller <i>kaput</i>!
Verdun <i>kaput</i>!” One might have imagined that the
whole world was <i>kaput</i>! The gentler-minded among
the townsfolk flashed electric torches in our faces,
saying modestly: “You know that our armies are but
a few leagues from Paris?” The better educated
regaled us with French. “La foilà,” they said mockingly,
“la grande nation!” People streamed out of
the public-houses as we went by. On the threshold
the calm and paunchy drinkers waved their mugs and
vented their guffaws. The whole city was agog
beneath the great royal and imperial standards. It
was really ludicrous, all this fuss about fifty field
hospital orderlies.</p>

<p>It was quite clear that the German nation was the
martyr of Europe. “As for us,” said my friend the
<i>Feldwebel</i>, “our conscience is quite at ease!” Yes,
we, the French, were the aggressors; we were the
<i>apaches</i> who had come furtively (<i>sicut fur in nocte</i>) to
disturb the dignified repose of these excellent people,
full of humanity, thoughtful and gentle! It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
unquestionably the anger of an offended conscience,
the holy joy of justice at length avenged, which found
expression in this tumult. How easy it is to distort
facts, to cook public opinion! I looked on and
listened with greater interest than at the most exciting
of plays. From the casements, graceful beneath
their Gothic gables and bright with window-gardens,
imprecations rained down on us. And the gestures
of the silhouetted figures standing in the front of
these lighted interiors sufficed to show those among
us who could not understand Swabian the significance
of the volleys of homeric abuse.</p>

<p>I was not in the least humiliated by the hubbub. My
condition was one of strange exaltation. I was very
sad and yet fascinated—sad at the spectacle of mankind,
and yet fascinated at the chance of seeing man as
he really is. Tacitus, Machiavelli, Stendhal, Ferrero—not
one of these writers had succeeded in giving me
so strong an impression of human reality. But I will
defer my comments. Thoughts conceived under the
spur of hunger and in a sort of physical dementia
are not likely to be just. Besides, it is difficult to
keep one’s head cool when the whole world is
crumbling around one. I fear lest I may have to
laugh some day at the partiality of this simple and
matter-of-fact story, written for some one whom I
love, and in which I faithfully desire to use no
colours but those of truth.</p>

<p>Of our arrival at the fort I can recall nothing but
the memory of a great iron gate which groaned on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
its hinges when it was opened, of a few lanterns
held by sentinels running hither and thither in the
darkness, of a gloomy and nauseous staircase where
I stumbled and where my nailed boots made a clatter
that aroused distant echoes, and of a casemate, this
casemate, with cemented floor, bare, without even
straw, its arches sweating damp. I threw myself on
the floor, my cheek on my knapsack. My head was
throbbing with fever. I spent a sleepless night, not
thinking, but a prey to delirium.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="FEVER_AND_LOW_SPIRITS">FEVER AND LOW SPIRITS</h2>

<p class="right"><i>September 16, 1914.</i></p>

<p>The casemate is empty. My comrades have gone up
to the nine o’clock roll-call. I am still “confined to
my room by illness.” I am happy to be alone. It is
cold. Wrapping my rug closely round me, I lie listening
to the bitter wind. I am alone; I am free. It seems to
me that the current of life has swept me away to the
end of the world, depositing me amid dumb deserts of
infinite vastness.</p>

<p>The straw upon which I have been lying for a fortnight
is reduced to powder. I roll myself in it as if it
were a dust bath for chickens. How thin is my rug!
My limbs shake with the cold of fever. Yesterday for
a quarter of an hour I dragged myself along in the east
court, but I was unable to get as far as the first glacis.
When I was coming downstairs on the way back, my
legs seemed heavier than hand grenades. I am very
cold. Through the upper part of the two screened
windows I catch a glimpse of a strip of sky, grey and
heavy, crushing down on the slope, on the portcullis
on the top of the slope, on the wild rose bush which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
breaks the straight line of the portcullis. On the steep
slope I see the long grass bending before the gusts.</p>

<p>I am alone. How delightful! What wealth! What
a privilege! Here we are never alone.</p>

<p>We sleep, we dress, we eat, we amuse ourselves, we
walk about, we hunt for lice, we attend to the calls of
nature, we dream, we are filled with indignation, we
soften, we caress the dear relics hidden in our knapsacks,
we retire into ourselves—we do all this in
public.</p>

<p>How well do I understand the phrase of St. Bernard,
the phrase of a monk, <i>O beata solitudo, sola beatitudo</i>!
Sometimes in the morning, when we awaken, this
awakening devoid of dignity, full of oaths, when the
same voices gabble the same platitudes, in the same
eternal access of sterile boredom, makes me feel
positively sick. How long will it continue, this life
in a herd? It seems to me that the effluvium of the
crowd, of the sweat of human cattle, has penetrated into
all the interstices of my soul.</p>

<p>No, it is useless; the effort to pull myself together and
to become what I was before these days in prison is too
much for my poor strength. I am shivering with cold.
To throw off this torpor I should need to eat three or
four times as much as we are allowed. Alas! the
wretched half loaf of the first few days has been reduced
to a third of a loaf, for the German authorities are
methodically restricting our rations. Even the dullest
of the soldiers, heavy, good-natured fellows, those who
never think and consequently waste very little energy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
find it difficult to keep going. Poor mothers, could you
but catch a glimpse of your sons, your fine lads, those
whom you used to pet so tenderly! On the slopes and
in the dry ditches of the fort you would see them gloomy
and slow, with drawn features, with a yellow and dirty
skin, almost always crouching on the ground. They
look like shades in Purgatory. Are these the youths
of France?</p>

<p class="tb">Sergeant Bertrand is the first to come down. Without
saying a word, he throws himself on his heap of
straw beside me. Then, one behind the other, come
dreamily in Sergeant Boude and Guido, my terrible
and dear Guido. Soon all the rest of the section enters,
a stamping and noisy rout.</p>

<p>Bertrand does not move. Leaning against his knapsack,
pipe in mouth—a pipe carved by Boude—he looks
straight in front of him. He is in a fine fit of the blues,
our “agent de change,” as he is nicknamed by his
comrades from Marseilles. If his fiancée could see
him thus, his fiancée of Ciotat!</p>

<p>At the end of the room, beneath the windows, two
groups are playing cards for pfennig stakes. Beyond
them, leaning against the bars, Sabatier, grave and
mute like a bonze, is plaiting a horsehair watch-chain.
Over there, from every mouth, from all the Bavarian
pipes hanging over the players’ stomachs, there mount
thick clouds of smoke.</p>

<p>In our corner, spoken of as the “club” by the men
of the “fond” (the window end), every one is silent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Bertrand is in Ciotat. Guido, hunched against the
wall, his képi pulled down over his eyes, seems to be
turning over thoughts even more disconsolate than
those of the <i>Imitation</i> or of <i>Ecclesiastes</i>. Boude, the
good Boude, with the soul of an artist who has lost
his way in everyday life, stands up, looking at our
trio.</p>

<p>All of a sudden, Bertrand, with a yawn, murmurs,
“I would sell my life for a penny.”</p>

<p>Boude smiles at his <i>alter ego</i>. “For my part, old
chap, I brought with me from Marseilles a certain store
of philosophy.”</p>

<p>“That also gets used up, Sergeant Boude,” says Guido,
“just as certainly as the cigar that you are smoking. And
once your cigar is finished, in these times of dearth, you
may find it difficult to get another.” Then, turning to
me, and lowering his harsh voice: “Richeris,” he says,
“is the happiest of us all. For him there is nothing
but God. If God wills it, he is satisfied; if God does
not will it, he is equally satisfied.”</p>

<p>Silence for a time.</p>

<p>Then Boude remarks quietly: “I’m going to visit
big Boétti. His dreams seem to come true. On the
19th, the night before our capture, he had a red
dream. Perhaps last night he may have had a blue
one.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” observes Guido, with a laugh, “I too have, not
dreams, but presentiments which come true. The day
of Boétti’s dream, when we had left Bourdonnaye and
were in the marshy wood just before you get to Dieuze,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
I said to myself, ‘This time it’s all up with you, old
chap, absolutely all up!’ You see, it <i>is</i> all up, and
for a good long time!”</p>

<p>Then Boude, “Oh, Guido, you see everything in dark
colours.”</p>

<p>“Quite true, I see everything in dark colours. I
leave it to you others to gaze through the rose-tinted
window. I keep to the gloomy outlook. Until a day
or two ago I had hopes of freedom in October. But
since Riou has read us the news, what he calls ‘good
news,’ I hope no longer.”</p>

<p>“All the same, I’m going to see Boétti,” declares
Sergeant Boude, opening the door.</p>

<p>The club relapses into silence. Bertrand dreams.
Guido, his faith in original sin thoroughly re-established,
meditates upon misfortune and upon human malice.</p>

<p class="tb">Oh, how empty and sterile life is. My head swims.</p>

<p>Lambert, who sees that I am shaking with cold, little
Lambert, kindly and gentle as a good grandfather,
comes and wraps his rug round my shoulders. He
gives me a cheerful smile, but says nothing. Returning
to his place opposite mine, he devotes himself once
more to the study of the civil code. The comrades
at the other end of the room noisily continue their
game of cards. Sabatier, hard at work, is standing up.
It is raining, and the windows have been closed.
Young Soulier, stretched at full length on his back,
his hands beneath his head, staring at vacancy, whistles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
an unending succession of operatic airs, music-hall songs,
waltzes, and tangos. I listen. Gradually this flow of
sounds wearies me, and ends by exasperating me.
What shall I do? Faces of those I love, how in this
pit of fever and weariness I endeavour to revive you in
memory. Where are you now? If one could only
write. Very likely they think we are dead. Has the
Ministry of War notified them of our imprisonment?
Does the Ministry itself know?</p>

<p>Lambert’s rug has made me feel warmer. I have
taken from my haversack the manual of French-German
conversation the commandant has lent me.
I read the dialogue which deals with agricultural life.
<i>Wiese</i>, <i>Wald</i>, <i>Gebüsch</i>, <i>Saatfeld</i>, <i>Ackerfurche</i>, <i>Herde</i>,
<i>Mühle</i>, <i>Landhaus</i>. These humble words seem friendly.
I read them again. I murmur them to myself half
aloud. Laying the book on my knee, I repeat them
slowly by heart.</p>

<p>Is there some magic charm in these simple vocables?
Called up by the sounds, images of freshness, so soothing
to my fever, come to keep me company. I forget
Soulier and his music. I no longer hear the wrangles
of the card-players. The misery of being nothing
better than a poor sick mole at the bottom of a crypt is
gradually effaced from my mind. The magic of words!
Yet these words are the words of the enemy. My
brain finds relief. My eyes are caressed by pure
colours. My ears are delighted with the supple
cadences of melodies which recall the scent of hay and
pastoral quietude. It seems to me that I am in a sun-kissed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
village. In front of the pillared porch of the
white church, dazzling white against the limpid blue
sky, apple-cheeked girls are playing games. How
charming is the aspect of their flaxen plaits against
their mauve aprons! How graceful their movements!
How angelic the clear ring of their voices! They smile
in a comradely way as they look at me. But you are
the daughters of the enemy, little sisters singing so
sweetly, little sisters whom I love.…</p>

<h2 id="DINNER">DINNER</h2>

<p class="right"><i>September 20, 1914.</i></p>

<p>It is exactly a month since we were taken prisoner.
Here is the great event of this day of jubilee. It is
a culinary event. None but the famished could
appreciate it.</p>

<p>I dressed hastily, for I had to be upon the upper
slopes at seven o’clock. I had an appointment with a
peasant woman, small, thin, with scanty hair, who
comes here from time to time to cut the grass.
Yesterday she brought me two pounds of sugar. The
price was sixty pfennig. I gave her a mark, telling
her to keep the change for her two girls. These latter,
working bare foot in the damp grass, rewarded me with
a profusion of reiterated <i>Danke schön</i>, and I had said to
myself that they were good folk. Acting on this impression,
I commissioned them to buy chocolate to the
value of three marks, to be delivered next day at seven
o’clock. <i>Morgen früh, sieben Uhr.</i> This matter having
been settled, I took possession of the wheelbarrow,
heavy with damp grass, and, as fast as I could,
followed by the three breathless Bavarians, I trundled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
my load as far as the guardhouse, nearly slipping a
dozen times on the smooth slopes.</p>

<p>Here I am then at seven o’clock to keep the
appointment. From this spot there is a view over
the entire fort and the huge plain of Ingolstadt. A
thin haze limits the horizon. White vapours rise from
the Danube. Some factory chimneys behind the town
are slowly vomiting their black plumes straight up into
the foggy sky. Not a stir in the air. The houses on
the plain have a liliputian aspect, seeming lost in the
immensity.</p>

<p>There was no one in the upper courts, no one on
the slopes. How pleasant it was in this damp solitude.
Church bells in the neighbouring villages were ringing
for mass. It was raining steadily—a gentle, quiet
rain. I took shelter beneath a parapet and waited.
Close at hand a poor little acacia was softly dripping.
Since I left for the war, this was the first time I had
begun the day quite alone. The “Our Father”
mounted to my lips. I prayed for France, for all the
soldiers of the <i>Völkerkrieg</i>. I prayed for my own dear
ones … God, France, Andrée.…</p>

<p>Still the woman did not come. My coat was
drenched. I was hungry. I made up my mind to
abandon my fruitless errand.</p>

<p>In the casemate it was just like any other morning.
Each one of us pushes back against the wall the
truss of straw which the previous night he had spread
out to make his bed, arranging it to form a rectangle,
and covering it with a Bavarian rug. Thus, round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
the “square” we have two rows of low couches, greyish
brown in colour, provided by way of cushions with our
knapsacks padded with our French rugs. The two
chambermaids—to-day they are Sabatier and Ancey—sweep
the floor and trim the lamp. When the work
is finished our casemate looks almost coquettish.</p>

<p>Now Guido returns from mass. Standing silent
in the draughty doorway, he smokes his first cigarette.
I instantly perceive that he has an idea, and ask for
information. He thinks of nothing less than commemorating
the melancholy jubilee of our capture
by a cup of chocolate. A great thought, but difficult to
realize! I hesitate. But Guido, egged on by hunger,
is resolute. Knowing that I am on good terms with
the kitchen, without further discussion he gives me a
mess-tin and a few sticks of Suchard, saying, “You can
manage it all right.” Doubtfully I make my way to the
<i>Küche</i>. I open the door. A cloud of steam and smoke
rushes out, enwraps me, and almost chokes me. In this
fog I knock up against a Norman from the Auge
valley—“Marie, the scullerymaid.” Without explanation
I hand over what I am carrying. “That’s all
right!” he says. I return to the casemate. “All
well?” asks Guido. “All well,” I answer. In a few
minutes Marie, alias Auguste, appears. He has the
mien of a conspirator! Beneath his stained and greasy
tunic he conceals as well as he can the hot vessel.
With a secret air he says: “Here it is!” “Bravo!”
I exclaim. But can this be my mess-tin? It is quite
black, like the bottom of a cooking pot. The tin has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
melted and run into warty drops half-way up. Yes, it
is really my mess-tin; but what a baptism of fire it
must have experienced! Never mind. In a trice
Guido makes a cunning hole in the straw to keep
it hot and to conceal the windfall. Hurrah! everything
is ready.</p>

<p>In the casemate, stretched out on our blankets, we all
await the dinner-hour.</p>

<p>“Room 17!” comes the cry from without. We
leap to our feet. Two by two, as is the custom in
German barracks, we make our way to the kitchen—a
long procession of individuals who chatter impatiently
in the dark and evil-smelling passages. When we
reach the happy door we are arrested by the order,
“Halt.” We have to wait until those of room 16 have
been served and dismissed. Now comes the moment.
“Seventeen, enter!” orders Dutrex. We defile in
front of the cauldron, and each man in turn holds out
his bowl to the cook. This last, Davit, an Angevin,
wearied of doing the same thing five hundred times
in succession, handles the great ladle mechanically,
absorbed in his own thoughts. His arms and shoulders
are bare, and one cannot doubt that he has the torso of
the Farnese Hercules.</p>

<p>One by one, hastily and yet cautiously, we return to
the casemate. Reclining in Roman fashion, seated or
squatting, we crumble into the clear liquid, faintly
sweetened, a little of our rye and barley bread, of the
consistency of putty, and forming a pappy mass in the
soup. The silence is religious. Eating is a solemn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
function in these days of scarcity. For a lengthy
interval nothing is to be heard in the “square” but the
rattling of spoons upon tin.</p>

<p>In our corner, where two friends sitting very close
together sip steaming chocolate, the fervour is even
greater than among those who are taking what we
good-humouredly speak of as “café-au-lait.” Our
mothers would consider our brew extremely crude.
No milk! No sugar! But the palate of a prisoner
of war differs from that of a pampered child. Bending
over our joint mess-tin, Guido and I are silently and
sadly happy. Poor joys of the famished, how one
makes the most of you with a greedy and simple
soul!</p>

<h2 id="FONTAINEBLEAU">FONTAINEBLEAU</h2>

<p class="right"><i>September 21, 1914.</i></p>

<p>You remember that Andromache, made captive when
Troy fell and allotted to Neoptolemus, the son of
Achilles, rebaptized with Trojan names the streams
and the hills of the Epirot capital, adorning the
gloomy present with glorious memories. As at Troy,
she had her Scamander. In this way, on clear nights,
when she walked beside the river in the solitary
fever of insomnia, it was sometimes possible for her
to forget Neoptolemus and the hatred of the Greeks,
and to dream of herself still living beside Hector as
queen, wife, and happy mother.</p>

<p>All prisoners are alike, be they epic heroines or
soldiers of the third republic. I, too, have my
Scamander in Epirus.</p>

<p>On the slopes of the fort there are a few poor trees.
I do not know how they manage to grow there, for very
thin is the layer of grass-clad earth which covers the
cemented arches. The rain runs off as from a tiled
roof, and the weakest sun scorches the humus. Nevertheless,
on the northern spur there is a squad of small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
acacias with two or three stunted poplars, sheltering
beneath their scanty shade a humble growth of mosses,
dwarf gentians, scabiouses, and thyme.</p>

<p>When the réveillé sounds, before the fort is overrun
by the other prisoners, I visit this little “grove.” The
habit, somewhat undisciplined, is of recent growth. I
have known my Thebaïd for two days only; I am
there for the third time this morning to revive my
memories, not of Ilium, but of Fontainebleau.</p>

<p>Fontainebleau!</p>

<p>Do you remember last May, during the week when
the great poplars of the Allée Sully were scattering
their down on the water of the pond? There was
some of it in your hair the morning when I spoke to
you. You looked straight in front of you, as in a
vision. You were walking without saying a word,
bending backwards, restraining the impatience of the
enleashed Katia and Douchka.</p>

<p>In the evening we walked together on the fringe of
the forest. The night was warm and fine, and the petals
rained gently on us as we went. Our acacias were in
flower. We looked at the moon through the slender
network formed by their white clusters.</p>

<p>My poor Fontainebleau of Ingolstadt!</p>

<h2 id="AN_OLD_CAMPAIGNER">AN OLD CAMPAIGNER</h2>

<p class="right"><i>September 22, 1914.</i></p>

<p>There are more than a thousand of them squatting
on the grass. The sun rages down on this quadrilateral,
as big as the Place des Victoires, enclosed
by the steep slopes of the scarp. Every one is
nodding. The German flag and the Bavarian flag
hang inertly along their twin staves. This frippery
has been hoisted to celebrate the taking of ⸺.
There is not a breath of wind. The heat is stifling.
Sentinels pace to and fro. What is going on behind
the forbidden slopes? Above the parapets crowned
with flowers we can see nothing but the sky—a wide
sky, barely blue. Some prisoners are chatting as they
sit on a pyramid of grenades.</p>

<p>“How short our campaign was!” exclaims Sergeant
Foch of the 10th Chasseurs, a fine fellow who seems
modelled in bronze. His dark, golden-speckled eyes
seem to devour you. He speaks harshly, and one
feels that his wrath is intense. He spits out his
phrases, with long intervals of silence.</p>

<p>“And all this happened through an idiot who led<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
us straight to Raon-l’Etape, a regular Boche
ambush!…</p>

<p>“As for me, tonnerre de Dieu, I could not help
thinking of our captain. Captain B.! He was a
soldier, if you like—first man of his year in the
Ecole de Guerre, certain to become a general. One
day he showed us the photo of his children, seven
children, all in a row. He had tears in his eyes.
He was a man! He could do what he liked with
us. He was brave and prudent, and we had nothing
to do but to follow where he led. One felt safe
with him. There was a man who knew how to take
care of his company.</p>

<p>“I wish you’d seen what happened at Vallerystal!
Such a rain of shells we had there. I counted five
hundred on my own section alone. I lost my two
chums there. One of them came from my own
village, and he and I were like brothers—always
together. All of a sudden there came a pig of a
melinite shell. There was a hell of a noise and a
lot of smoke. I was knocked out of time, bowled
over and over. Then I got up and dusted myself.
Absolutely unhurt! Oh, how that black smoke stank!
And on either side of me my two chums, blown to
bits, their guts bulging out all over the place. Cré
nom de nom! My knapsack did me good service
that time! It stopped a shell splinter which set the
collar of my coat on fire behind. Just look.</p>

<p>“While this was going on, what do you think
our captain was doing? He was walking quietly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
up and down, pipe in mouth, in front of our
rifles.</p>

<p>“‘Better lie down, captain,’ we said to him.</p>

<p>“‘What’s the use? One’s just as likely to be hit
lying down as standing.’</p>

<p>“By the evening he had a wound in the head and
a torn biceps. Do you think he left us on that
account? His wounds were temporarily dressed.</p>

<p>“‘You must go to the field hospital,’ said the
surgeon. But he did not go! There’s a fellow for
you. If they were all like this B.…”</p>

<p>“Did it do well, your section?” asked Piétri, a red-haired
sergeant-major, sturdy, with bloodshot eyes, a
Corsican with the trick of staring you in the face,
seeming to listen with his eyes, greedily, like a
deaf man.</p>

<p>“Did they do well? I believe you! My reservists
were splendid. ‘The beasts!’ they cried. They were
spoiling for the fight; they clenched their fists. The
10th battalion was proverbial. ‘The men at Provenchères
are devils,’ said the Boches; it was we.</p>

<p>“At the start it was like playing at soldiers. The
Uhlans were coming on in little groups, their gloves
spotless with pipeclay, wheeling to right and to left,
as if on parade. Bram! Bram! Down goes one of
them. The others perform a fantasia of retreat. We
pursue. They dismount. I say to my men: ‘Lie
down!’ Not a bit of it! They kneel to take better
aim. ‘Fire!’ A lieutenant is killed; there are six
dead or wounded. Another time, four Uhlans are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
trotting quietly along the road, as if on scouting
duty. ‘Fire!’ Ten shots: patrol gone! Yes, it was
funny at first. One might have imagined oneself at
the summer manœuvres. But from the 10th to the
25th, oh Lord! Nothing but artillery fire. It rained!
It rained, I tell you!”</p>

<p>“Did you kill any Boches yourself?” asks big
Corporal Durupt, compared in the 2nd to a buffalo’s
head on a pikestaff. “In my section at Mesnil, near
Senones, I handed my rifle to the bugler, a record
shot. In a quarter of an hour, at two hundred yards,
he brought down ten.”</p>

<p>“I did my share,” answers Foch. “But the shot of
which I am proudest was one which I fired at twelve
hundred yards, just for a lark, at a Uhlan patrol.
There were three of them; I bowled one of them
over. But I will tell you about a shot of which my
old comrade Kaiser was especially proud. An Alsatian
like myself. I always gave him his orders in German.
I don’t know if he’s still alive. I have not seen him
since August 25th, when we were under machine gun
fire in Bertrichamps wood.</p>

<p>“In my section we had one odd sort of beast who
was always in a blue funk. I kept him by my side
as I led my section. The captain says to me: ‘Foch,
see if you can’t stop this machine gun which is
worrying us.’ Off we go, and soon the bullets are
flying thickly. I meet an old territorial. He has his
handkerchief pressed to a bleeding wound. I want
to dress it for him. ‘No, no,’ he says, ‘don’t bother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
about me. Go ahead with your brave fellows!’ All
at once my trembler falls down, crying out:</p>

<p>“‘Mon Dieu! mon Dieu!’</p>

<p>“‘Are you wounded?’</p>

<p>“‘No, a sprain!’</p>

<p>“‘Don’t you try to gammon me; up with you!’
He gets up; he can walk all right. ‘You see,’ I tell
him, ‘I beat God Himself. I’ve cured you in half a
tick.’ But now, at two hundred yards, I see the
German section with the machine gun. I fire, once,
twice; I pick off two of them. Then, close at hand,
on the right, appears a bunch of Germans. The
devil! I call Kaiser, who is acting as my orderly.
A Boche advances on him. ‘Look out!’ I cry. The
Boche shoulders his rifle and fires. Down goes
Kaiser. The Boche advances, but Kaiser is only
shamming dead. Suddenly he rises on his knee.
Bram! Head over heels goes the other, and Kaiser
hurls himself on the Boche. ‘I’ve got him all right,’
he shouts, as pleased as Punch.</p>

<p>“The German squad retreats. My section sends
them some parting shots. Two wounded Germans
come to us, and I dress their wounds. One of them
wants to kiss me, but I’m not having any.</p>

<p>“I say to my funker, ‘Get behind that little ridge.
You will be close to me.’ I have hardly spoken when
he begins to bleat: ‘Wounded! I am wounded! I’ve
been shot in my behind. Let’s escape!’ Next minute,
‘Mon Dieu! hit again! Let’s escape!’ Two bullets
in his behind; oh dear! He did not know what to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
do with himself; he had not enough hands to stop
the holes. He let go of one leg in order to seize the
other. We who looked on were screaming with
laughter. I’ve never laughed so much in my life.
And all this was under fire! Girard was laughing
with the rest. Then, suddenly, ‘I am hit,’ he says;
‘lend a hand!’—‘You must wait a moment, old boy;
the fire is too hot.’ The blood was pouring from
his wound, making a lather like soapsuds. Two
minutes later the bugle sounds ‘Cease firing.’ But
they don’t want to cease firing. They simply will
not stop. I have to get up and shout at them, to
brandish my arms. At length they assemble around
me. And here is my funker, who gets up quite
easily, notwithstanding the two bullets in his behind.
The firing continued from the German side, and the
leaves were falling on us from the trees, for the aim
was too high. We were able to withdraw with our
eight wounded.</p>

<p>“Ah, it was a fine time, but oh, how tired I was!
Had it not been for ⸺ I should have gone through
the war till the last shot was fired. I no longer
gave a thought to my wife or my children.”</p>

<h2 id="I_HAVE_A_TABLE">I HAVE A TABLE</h2>

<p class="right"><i>September 23, 1914.</i></p>

<p>The useful furniture of our casemate consists of the
following articles: a ewer, a dish, and a lamp. I
say “the useful furniture,” for we have also an
imposing iron stove, some heavy bars of iron to
barricade the doors and windows, and two pieces of
sheet iron about half an inch thick. But there is no
table. There was one at first, but they took it away
from us to furnish the chapel, where it serves as
altar. As for chairs, benches, stools, there is nothing
of the sort. Consequently a man who wishes to
write, and who has never written except seated at a
table, is not likely to feel thoroughly at home in
casemate 17.</p>

<p>First I made myself a study out in the open, in
a corner of the east court, on the steps of a little
cement stairway in the slopes. I got some fine headaches
there, sitting for hours in the sun without
noticing it. But rainy weather having set in, it
became necessary to seek shelter.</p>

<p>It is at this point that Dutrex intervenes in my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
prison life—Corporal Dutrex, of martial and elegant
figure, a strange compound of the ingratiating characteristics
of childhood and the energy of manhood.
At Bièvre, in Belgium, when the village of Messin
was burning, and when under the fire of machine
guns our soldiers were effacing themselves in the
furrows, Dutrex, ammunition bag on shoulder and
cigarette in mouth, walked unconcernedly from one
rifleman to another distributing packets of cartridges.</p>

<p>Arriving here with the first convoy on August 27th,
his knowledge of German immediately led to his selection
as interpreter to the commandant. By degrees he
has become Major von Stengel’s right-hand man. I
noticed the young fellow from the first. He is blond,
with a long, fine moustache, with hair cut en brosse, thin,
very erect. I remember that I felt a secret joy when
I discovered that this simple corporal of the ⸺th
occupied so important a position in the fort. It was
pleasing that the German authorities should see France
through the medium of this particular Frenchman.
Too often have I had the misfortune to study the
deficiencies of the official hierarchy, and the unanticipated
revenge now taken by the natural hierarchy was
agreeable to my reason.</p>

<p>To Dutrex, then, one wet and gloomy morning, in
quest of shelter for my pen, I explained my difficulties.
He knew my <i>Ecoutes</i>, and we had been friends from
the first. At noon he handed me the key of the double
casemate, No. 55.</p>

<p>With the permission of the commandant he has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
established a store here. From nine to ten daily,
soap, slippers, brushes, blacking, string, and other little
necessaries, are sold at cost price.</p>

<p>In this heroic place, a real ice-house, with walls of
formidable thickness and screened windows, I spent a
long afternoon. I fell ill at once in consequence. That
very evening when I returned to No. 17 I was shaking
with fever. It cost me a week on the straw. But I bear
no grudge against No. 55. It secured me the exquisite
luxury of a few hours’ isolation. I shall always think
kindly of its strong and cold arches, of its chains for
moving the garrison-guns, and of its sepulchral atmosphere,
faintly perfumed with haberdashery. But I shall
not renew my acquaintance with it, for I learn that the
occupants of No. 70, who were being eaten alive by
lice, have been transferred to 55. I commiserate
them for having to make their choice between lice and
rheumatism! As for Dutrex, his soap and other wares
have been removed to No. 72, where the sun never enters.</p>

<p>I am now able to work in a warm and dry place,
for yesterday, as honorary minister without portfolio,
I entered what is spoken of as “the French governing
body” of the fort.</p>

<p>Do you think these vain honours? Not at all, for
they provide me with a table. To have table and lamp
of one’s own, with many hours all to oneself for observation
and reflection! In my view, free time is preferable
to money. “Time is money,” say the English. I
would rather say “Money is time.” It seems to me
that the only object of working is to secure leisure.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
The man within us is formed by leisure. Work produces
money, money produces leisure, and leisure produces
more work—but this last is noble, lofty, and
disinterested work, the true work of humanity. With
me it is an article of faith that the true work of
humanity is the work of leisure. Thank goodness I
have now a little leisure and solitude.</p>

<p>My solitude, a very precarious one, is a kitchen.
You must not laugh.</p>

<p>Near the door of the huge room is the region of the
cooking stoves, encumbered, filled with iron and smoke,
under the care of Bouquet, the “chef,” a delicate and
gentle lad from Quercy. But beyond this plutonic
zone you enter a spacious quadrilateral, which the cooks
usually speak of as the “salon.” Two large windows
looking to the south flood the place with light. It is
fairly clean. The cemented floor is flushed down with
water after the vegetables have been prepared, after the
serving of each of the three meals, and, speaking generally,
whenever there has been much coming and going.
At the further end of this kitchen, between the two
windows, there stands a table, a little deal table, <i>the</i>
table. M. Prudhomme would say: “This table, it is
the heart of Fort Orff.” It is here, in fact, that is
established, in almost continuous sitting (upon three
deal stools), our ministerial council. Here we plan
reforms. Here we elaborate details of organization.
Here is regulated the entire internal life of the colony.
It is here, finally, that by means of various stratagems
we learn the news from outside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>This table, or to be precise, the left side of this
table, is now mine. The deep mouth of the sink yawns
just behind my stool on the floor level. As I work,
my left arm touches the window-sill, on which I
place my pipe, my mess-tin, my papers, and your
photograph. Such is my kingdom. Here I read,
write, and dream. Here thrice daily when meals are
served I watch my brothers in captivity file by. Here
I listen, and here I observe. Notwithstanding the buzz
of talk, the trampling of those at work, and the smoke
from the fire, I delight in this corner close to the cooking
stoves. Upon our scanty regimen I have become
as chilly as a cat. Besides, where else could I work?</p>

<p>Thus my life is divided between my “Fontainebleau
of the slopes,” my stool in kitchen No. 22, and casemate
17. For I continue to sleep on my old heap of
straw. It is nothing more than a derisory bed of dust,
but I am more comfortable there than I was the first
night. I am glad to say that my back is now covered
with callus; my nose has become hardened; even my
ears during the night are less sensitive than they were
at first to the noises, now strident, now guttural, of the
sleepers. At the outset, suffering from insomnia, I
passed hour after hour, sickened by this frogs’ chorus.
I longed to run away from it. I summoned sleep with
all my might. Smile if you like, but I feel my faith in
the human soul weaken when I contemplate a sleeping
man whose mouth gapes and who snores like a great
hog. The horrible stench which tainted the damp
breeze at Moncourt, Lagarde, and Kerprich, rising from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
the putrefying corpses of men and beasts, was to my
mind less strongly insistent of the animal relationships of
man than is the slow, irregular rhythm, the dull and undignified
noise, of snoring. But one gets used to everything.
I have become accustomed to the snoring and
to the yet more disagreeable incidents of our too
intimate association. I hardly notice the foul smell
of drains which permeates the passages of our ant-hill,
and which made me feel positively faint on the evening
of our arrival. Man is so greedy for happiness that he
speedily becomes immunized against the toxin of his
daily troubles. Day by day I am less keenly conscious
of my miseries. At night, on my heap of dust, I often
meditate upon this marvellous characteristic of our
nature. Towards eleven, passing into a condition of
gentle melancholy, I manage to get off to sleep between
Sergeant Bertrand on one side, dreaming love
dreams, and my terrible and dear Guido on the other—Guido,
a prey to pessimism and insomnia, whose
cigarette continues to glow in the darkness.</p>

<h2 id="WE_KILL_THEIR_HOPES">WE KILL THEIR HOPES</h2>

<p class="right"><i>September 26, 1914.</i></p>

<p>Things are going badly with the Germans. Our
guards may keep their mouths as tightly shut as they
please, and may deprive us of newspapers, but despite
our isolation we feel that things are going well for
France.</p>

<p>There was a splendid sunrise. When I went out
to greet you and the dawn upon our acacia slope,
the cold was dry and sharp. The air had an agreeable
aroma of fresh earth. It was a pleasure to let the
eyes dwell upon the play of morning light across the
open country. The cord on the flagstaff, now bearing
no flag, shook in the wind and made a clicking sound
as it struck the wood. For a moment from underground
there came the sound of the bell rung at the
elevation, a gentle, calm, and mysterious sound. It
was the hour when Richeris and Guido are accustomed
to serve mass for one another.</p>

<p>In the kitchen I found Corporal Durupt at breakfast.
He stood with his back to the fire, poised askew on
his heron’s legs, looking, as usual, as long and thin as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
a hop-pole. The co-minister of Dutrex had toasted a
slice of black bread sprinkled with aniseed (bread which
he detests), and, rocking to and fro a little, was moistening
it in his bowl. Around him the great iron
cauldrons, which had been taken down from the
stoves ready for the distribution, were steaming like
locomotive engines. He was drinking his coffee with
a thoughtful air, one which gave him a lofty, conscientious,
incorruptible aspect. When he saw me his
large and trusty eyes sparkled. I detected a mischievous
twinkle behind his glasses.</p>

<p>Instantly he began: “I have <i>grand’chose</i> to tell
you.” He is an Alsatian and has phrases peculiar to
himself. In his vocabulary “grand’chose” means something
of extreme importance. And for Durupt there
is but one thing of real importance, and that is the
extermination of Prussia.</p>

<p>He hates Germany with a hatred which has been a
cult in the Durupt family for generations. He went
to school at Mülhausen. He took part with the Alsatian
boys in terrible fights with the German boys.
Thus, in his case, hatred of the Teuton was in the first
instance a suggestion of childhood. But this hatred has
become envenomed by experience and mature reflection.
At an age when the heart begins to devote itself to the
work of life, he was subjected to the forcible, rough,
relentless constraint imposed by the foreign master.
The daily experience of “Germanization” had filled
his kindly nature with gall against everything German.</p>

<p>“At Paris,” he says sometimes, “in the restaurants,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
in the post-offices, wherever I could, I plagued the life
out of all the Boches who came my way!” On the
banks of the Brusche, and especially at Saulxures,
where the two sides were firing at one another haphazard
in the fog, he killed furiously. Now, being a
prisoner of war, and having neither rifle nor bayonet,
he devotes himself to the endeavour to sow discouragement
among the soldiers who guard us, considering that
an army contaminated with discouragement is ripe for
defeat.</p>

<p>Durupt is a thoroughly upright man. His everyday
judgments and his ordinary actions recall the evangel
of ’48 and the solid bourgeois virtues. He belongs to
that undistinguished élite which forms the real backbone
of every nation, the élite consisting of those who
know how to speak the truth and to live for truth.
Above all, he belongs to that France unknown to
foreigners (although in it is concealed the secret of our
marvellous resurrections), to that moral France which
lies ever hidden beneath Gallic and frivolous France,
producing, as times change, a St. Louis, a Calvin, a
Saint-Cyran, a Pascal, a Lamennais, or a Fallot, men
of a single colour, with consciences of iron, terrible to
themselves, obedient to the point of heroism, and often
scrupulous to the point of disease. Those I have
named are generals of the army in which Durupt
serves as a private.</p>

<p>He has a great love and admiration for his brother,
Jacques Durupt, Goude’s antagonist at Brest in the last
parliamentary elections, and, during the heroic times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
of Marc Sangnier, leader of the Sillonist left in
association with Gacmaling and Archambault.</p>

<p>Durupt himself lived on the confines of the Sillonist
movement. Like all the readers of <i>Démocratie</i> and
<i>Nouvelle Journée</i>, he has the republic and the
Christian faith in his blood.</p>

<p>I esteem our “co-triumvir.” I find him a trifle too
meticulous for my taste. He shows little interest in the
witty and graceful sides of life. He has a tendency to
emphasis, and is a little inclined to act the judge. He
is fond of giving an exemplary flavour to his actions,
and at times plumes himself somewhat when speaking
of what he does. But his heart is as clear as crystal,
utterly void alike of hypocrisy and malice. His whole
life, at home and abroad, even in its most trifling
details, is upright, controlled, deliberate.</p>

<p>A certain sympathetic pleasure attended my gradual
discovery in this Catholic of the merits and defects
characteristic of the Scottish puritan and of the French
radical. Moral, practical, ardently patriotic, ingrained
with the civic spirit, something of a preacher, without
any change in his modes of thought or his personal
habits he might well be regarded as a perfect disciple
of Christophe Dieterlen, Fallot, or Frommel, and even
of Charles Wagner, Paul Doumergue, or Wilfred
Monod, the file-leaders in France of reformed
Catholicism.</p>

<p>Everywhere, fortunately, men remain men. Protestants
have the Catholic spirit and Catholics have
the Protestant spirit. Individual psychology laughs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
at doctrinal oppositions. Throughout the entire
human race, temperaments and characters develop,
underground, their indestructible stratifications, regardless
of the walls built on the surface by the leaders of
men, walls which these leaders, with their imperious
will, imagine to be durable.</p>

<p>Durupt devotes to the indulgence of his national
hatred the whole of that conscience which his Christianity
(quasi-jansenist in type) has produced in him.
He hates as a duty. He injures as a duty. How can
he injure the Germans now that he is at their mercy?
By demoralizing their men! Having an excellent
knowledge of German, he has made it his mission at
Fort Orff to prove by a + b to our successive relays
of guards—Landwehr men on their way to the frontier,
or men wounded in the first onslaught and now returning
cured to the firing-line—that Germany is beaten in
advance.</p>

<p>He arrived here on August 30th, three days after
Dutrex, and the whole of Germany in the fort, from
the commissariat captain down to the last <i>Gemeiner</i>
(the commandant, whose conduct towards us has
throughout been a model of courtesy, always excepted),
set to work forthwith to din into his ears,
“Paris <i>kaput</i>”—literally translated, “Paris pulverized.”
For a whole fortnight this was the refrain. When the
quartermaster, an ill-natured beast, stupid and uncouth,
came down to the kitchens, his way of saying good-day
was to laugh maliciously as he announced a new
<i>kaput</i>: Verdun <i>kaput</i>; Rheims <i>kaput</i>; Manonviller<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
<i>kaput</i>! Even the <i>Verpflegsoffizier</i>, Captain Friedrich
Wilhelm Weidner, of the Prinz Ludwig regiment, a
Nuremberg merchant with a lofty air, very erect, much
mustachioed, with frank blue eyes, did not disdain, from
time to time, to unfold ostentatiously among the stoves,
under the noses of Dutrex and Durupt, copies of the
<i>Nürnberger Zeitung</i> and the <i>Münchener Neueste Nachrichten</i>
with headlines screaming victory.</p>

<p>These were their happy days. The gateway leading
to the open was black on Sundays with a gaping
crowd: townsfolk in their Sunday best, wearing cocks’
feathers in their green felt hats; rich farmers’ wives
trying to look comfortable in hats; swarms of children,
for the most part bare-footed; peasants in ill-fitting
ready-made clothes; pathetic village dames, clad as
in Dürer’s pictures, the head covered with a kerchief,
a black fichu over the shoulders, a wadded corsage to
fill out their figures. All these idlers, looking poverty
stricken when compared with those of like class in
France, would spend hour after hour staring at the
“pantalons rouges,” occasionally shouting through the
bars their eternal “Paris <i>kaput</i>,” the cry which had
been reiterated from Dieuze to Strasburg, from Stuttgart
to Ingolstadt, and with which our ears had been
ringing since our capture.</p>

<p>This foolish jubilation exasperated Durupt. He kept
quiet about it for some days. At length, however,
having recovered his spirits, he threw himself heart
and soul into the task of keeping up our hopes.</p>

<p>“It is absolutely impossible that we can be beaten,” he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
would say to the preachers of evil. “Agreed, their
advance guards are at Rheims, Meaux, and Compiègne.
But does this mean that Paris has been
taken? What about the naval guns with which the
Government has filled the forts? Make your minds
easy; they will lose much time and much blood before
they will plant their standard on the Place de la Concorde!
Let us suppose the worst. Let us suppose that
Paris has fallen. Does that finish the matter? Remember
Chanzy’s plan. In his view, the strategic bastion
of France is not Paris but the Massif Central, the
Auvergne and Cévennes mountains. Let them make
their way, then, to Clermont-Ferrand and Aurillac!
Besides, we are not fighting single-handed. The
Russian waterspout is getting ready, and will soon
break over them; it will make short work of their
five poor army corps. Its waters will dash on to
Berlin. The floods will chase their navy out of the
Kiel Canal, will force it into the North Sea—where
the English dreadnoughts are awaiting it, and will
swallow it at one gulp!”</p>

<p>The least enthusiastic among the prisoners were
enraptured at these speeches. Sometimes a voice
would be heard saying, “Even so, we shall be here
till the spring!” To which Durupt would peremptorily
reply: “All Saints’ Day will find us at home!
I know Germany as I know the palm of my hand. The
country is penniless. Moreover, it is not with France
alone, this time, that Germany has to do; she has
to fight France, Belgium, England, and Russia—that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
ocean of humanity. You must be mad, I tell you, if
you do not feel that Germany is going to be wiped
out!”</p>

<p>In these surroundings, Durupt is the man with a
duty, a mission. Though he is a prisoner, every hour
is fully occupied, each moment has its allotted task.
His life is governed by a single rule: “Every day in
which we fail to enlarge our own hopes and to spread
discouragement among the Germans is a day lost.”
Consequently, the essential matter for him is to secure
news.</p>

<p>The instant he has finished his supervision of the
distribution of our meals and his work in casemate 16,
off he goes on the hunt. He accosts Max, the canteen-keeper,
the mightiest beer-drinker on the Upper
Danube, a light-hearted soldier, florid, paunchy, so
rough that he laughs when he tells you that in the
Vosges a French shrapnel has just taken off his
brother’s arm, and yet, though rough, a good fellow.
It is from him that Durupt learns the gossip in the
<i>Wirtschaften</i> of Hepperg, Lenting, Kösching, Wegstätten,
Oberhaumstadt—in a word, in all the village
taverns within reach of the fort, both on the hills and
in the plain. Having finished with Max, he proceeds
to pump the guard.</p>

<p>Here his reception is rather cold, for he is a poor
diplomatist, and shows too plainly to these men of
the Landwehr that at bottom he is their hereditary
enemy. Still, he has a talk in the guardroom, smokes
a cigar, and drinks a glass of beer with the men,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
exchanging <i>Prosits</i>. Sometimes he sees on the table,
amid the beer-jugs and other debris of the meal, a
newspaper which they have forgotten to put away
when the Frenchman came in. My Durupt pounces
upon it and stuffs it into his pocket. He strides across
the bridge, hurries down the staircase, and bursts into
the kitchen, breathless and radiant, with the air of a
victorious athlete or a hero who has saved the republic,
and brandishes his paper as if it were a flag taken from
the enemy. Now he reads it, translates and comments,
with exclamations of joy or of rage at the passages
which delight or infuriate him. He actually talks,
argues, and fights with this newspaper; he regards it
as a flesh and blood Bavarian who is trying to deceive
him, and with whom he has to join issue. Woe to
the Bavarian if he does not admit defeat, or at least
disquietude, for he will then learn to what lengths
Durupt can go in his anger!</p>

<p>Never shall I forget these readings of the <i>Ingolstädter
Zeitung</i>. If I am ever tempted to doubt that the
press exercises a terrible power, that its influence
upon the public resembles that of a shell bursting in
a cavalry square, I shall call to mind certain hours
of imprisonment here, passed round our table, Durupt
reading aloud, Dutrex and I sketching maps to clarify
the news, while leaning over our shoulders, anxiously
following us, are Paix, Scherrer, Badoy, Noverraz,
Donel, Lagier, and a few others. When we break up
in the evening we know what will be the public sentiment
next day. According as Durupt is able to sing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
a triumphal pæan, or, on the other hand, the evidence
of misfortune is overwhelming, will our thousand
comrades be light-hearted or sad, will hope or despair
permeate the fort from this centre, from this table, from
the newspaper on this table, from the group of men
who sit round it evening after evening.</p>

<p>Sometimes Durupt, returning to the kitchen excited
by the chase, is pulled up by the notice I have posted
for the protection of my work: “Please do not speak
to me.” He then sits down beside me without saying
a word and unfolds the newspaper he has got hold
of. Elbows on table, head in hands, his whole body
bent eagerly forward, Claudel would say he is engaged
on the “ingurgitation” of his paper.</p>

<p>Look at him, dissecting the leading article, heavy
fare in which the most trifling details of information
are sandwiched between philosophical disquisitions.
He turns the fragments over and over as a starving
man turns over the contents of a dustbin. He labours
to unveil hidden meanings, to detect masked avowals.
He displays a truly German patience in securing here
and there, <i>rari nantes in gurgite vasto</i>, the name of
a town, the number of an army corps, or some other
shadow of positive information.</p>

<p>Then he brings forth his maps, which are shabby
in appearance, worn at the folds, stained by the rain
and sweat of his campaign in the Upper Vosges. He
takes out his pencil. He marks the places. At length,
unable to restrain himself any longer, he feels that
he must tell me what has happened. He turns my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
protective notice with its face to the wall, and starts
upon his commentary.</p>

<p>The splendid thing is that this commentary invariably
leads up to the proof of a victory. For him every
French retreat is a strategic movement, while every
German retreat is a rout. All good news is positively
certain; all bad news is a falsehood published to
restore the courage of the German populace. Guided
by these principles of criticism, he arrives at a certainty
of the truth; he then cons it over to himself, gives it
a portable form, and hurries off to disseminate it through
the fort. He bursts into No. 19, where Merlier, Charlier,
and Gautin receive him as an angel of the Lord; into
No. 17, where his enthusiasm breaks vainly against
the obstinate and disdainful pessimism of Guido; into
No. 34, where Brissot and d’Arnoult, two mischievous
devils who are equally well acquainted with German
and with the beer served out to the guardroom, treat
him simply as a gossip. Unfortunately, in the course
of his round he will encounter, now the quartermaster,
now a <i>Gefreiter</i>, now one of the sentinels.
Remorselessly he overwhelms them with his news,
thus making himself more unpopular with them than
before.</p>

<p>Thus he takes ample revenge for the “Paris <i>kaput</i>”
of the first few days. Dutrex and I chaff him about
it, saying: “You’re behaving like a Boche in being
so regardless of your adversaries’ feelings!”</p>

<p>“Poor fellows,” he makes answer, “it is obvious that
you don’t know the Germans. As far as they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
concerned the proverb is absolutely true: ‘Oignez vilain,
il vous poindra; poignez vilain, il vous oigndra!’”<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>I was walking the other day with Durupt and
Sergeant Foch. We were on the little footpath which
runs along the parapet, and opposite to us, across
the great ditch, on the road which skirts the outer
slopes, there appeared two German women. They
were walking slowly, wheeling bicycles, and they looked
at us curiously. We mended our gait, for no one likes
to look unhappy under the eyes of the enemy.</p>

<p>Durupt spoke to them in German.</p>

<p>“Have you a newspaper?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“What’s the latest news?”</p>

<p>“Things are going well in France.”</p>

<p>“For which side?”</p>

<p>“For ours. Trainloads of wounded are coming back
every day.”</p>

<p>“Your wounded?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“In that case, it is for our side that things are going
well!”</p>

<p>“Possibly.”</p>

<p>These women had such fat bodies and short legs as
to produce an impression of caricature. Sergeant Foch,
Alsatian and infantry chasseur, has a malicious wit.
He was cogitating a joke, but I managed to induce
him to suppress it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>We walked on slowly, talking across the ditch, and
the women said:</p>

<p>“You treat our prisoners badly, and you finish off
the wounded!”</p>

<p>“Who told you that?”</p>

<p>“It’s in the papers.”</p>

<p>“All your papers lie, and you are stupid enough to
believe them. It is just the same with the war news.
You are beaten everywhere. It’s perfectly clear to any
one who can read intelligently. Yet you believe yourselves
to be the victors! The newspapers take their
readers to be idiots. Is it possible that they are right?
The real fact is that we are starved here, whilst in
France, where people are rich and generous, your
prisoners are fed on the fat of the land!”</p>

<p>“It may be so. But it was those rascals of English
who caused all the trouble. If only I had them here!”
(the larger woman shook her fist). “The English are
the apaches of Europe (<i>die Lumpen Europas</i>)!”</p>

<p>Thus the conversation began. It must have lasted
about half an hour. The conscientious Durupt “sowed
discouragement” in the minds of his interlocutors,
refusing to leave them until he felt that their confidence
in victory had been undermined.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="SUNDAY">SUNDAY</h2>

<p class="right"><i>September 27, 1914.</i></p>

<p>I have been at work all the morning.</p>

<p>At ten o’clock, Guido came to fetch me for mass.
Under his arm he carried the great missal, borrowed
from the curé of Lenting, in which he likes me to
follow the service. The sermon was delivered by one
of his colleagues. It filled me with astonishment, so
harsh, so pitiless was its tone, reeking of fire and
brimstone, representing God as a cross between a
satrap and a bogy. The preacher seemed a veritable
priest of Saturn. His firmness of conviction, be it
noted, was absolute. But—shades of St. Francis of
Assisi and St. Francis of Sales, where were you?</p>

<p>Guido often discusses his faith with me in the
evenings, when, before the roll-call, we stroll together
on the deserted glacis, just after the stars have come
out. He takes great pains to expound to me the
beauties of the Catholic liturgy. It is, in very truth,
incomparable. For those who can believe in the
miracle of the host, nothing in the world can be so
touching or so sublime as the daily drama of the mass.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
But what a pity that it has to be said in Latin, so that
none but those who have had a classical education
can appreciate it to the full. This morning, for
instance, I doubt if there were three of the comrades
able to understand the Epistle and the Gospel of the
day. If it is considered essential to retain Latin as
a symbol of universalism, why should not the Latin
reading be instantly followed by vernacular rendering
of these verses of Scripture wherein are contained the
essentials of our faith, be it Roman Catholic or
Protestant?</p>

<p>Yet how simple and how moving was the ritual,
improvised, shortened, of necessity reduced to its
elements—altar, candles, incense, vestments. No Saint-Sulpician
imagery! Bare walls, rough and white.
It was possible to fancy oneself in a catacomb, in the
first ages of the church.</p>

<p>Quite recently this armoured keep has been deprived
of its four or five ancient guns. There they were at
their posts, muzzles in the loopholes, ready at the
supreme moment to sweep with their fire the north
of the counterscarp beyond the second encircling wall.
They had been in this damp crypt for perhaps thirty
years, without ever being used. Now they are on their
way to the Russian front. The Germans must be hard
put to it for guns, to make use of these relics!</p>

<p>The crowd of the faithful, French soldiers and
Bavarian <i>Landwehrleute</i>, standing indiscriminately,
peacefully pressed shoulder to shoulder, served to
warm the casemate a trifle. I shivered, none the less,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
whilst Boude, with a voice grave and sweet, sang the
ample strophes of the <i>Adoro te</i> of St. Thomas. At
one moment, impressed by the strong and noble
simplicity of this sanctuary of exile, I called up in
memory the interior of the church attended by the
bathers of Trouville. The contrast was so violent
that.…</p>

<p class="tb">In the curé of Lenting’s missal, I have read several
times lately, lying on my heap of straw, the couplets
of the <i>Adoro te</i>. What an ardent hymn it is! How
sublime is its cry of passion! When it was written, the
cult of the eucharist was, so to say, novel, and had
numerous opponents within the church. Béranger, the
Angevin, a species of early Calvin, denied the material
transformation of the elements. Christianity took
sides about the matter.</p>

<p>It is only periods of combat which are fruitful.
To-day the altar is too peaceable. Too many questions
are considered closed. I doubt if a St. Thomas
or a St. Bonaventura would now vie with one another
in love and genius to sing, as sincerely as did these
saints of old, the flesh and the blood of Christ in
the host.</p>

<p>Mass said, we hastened to the ordinary. It consisted
of soup and a morsel of pork. The distribution
of the meal lasted until two. Then Dutrex, Durupt,
the cooks, and I sat round the ministerial table to
dine in our turn. It was late, and we were hungry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
I furnished some cigars, smuggled goods. Dutrex
provided tea, likewise smuggled. As there were eight
of us and we had but four half-pint mugs, it was
necessary to use four enamelled iron bowls—basins
belonging to Fort Orff. The tea was lost in the
bottom of these; one might have imagined it had
been dispensed with a medicine-dropper. But how
good it was! With our half-pint mugs and our
bowls we clinked three times, drinking to France,
to the destruction of autocracy and militarism in
Europe, to those at home. Our meagre love-feast
had quite a family air. Cooks and “ministers” alike,
we all felt that we were truly brothers.</p>

<p>After dinner, Dutrex, Durupt, and I went for a walk.
There was a high wind as we strolled along the
parapets. In shady corners, I was able to pluck
some dwarf gentians, mosses, and lichens. I even
discovered a tuft of dwarf heather from which the
flowers had almost all fallen. I have arranged this
posy in my campaigner’s mug. There it is, beside
your portrait. If only we could hope to get away
from here before it fades!</p>

<p>Durupt left us to attend vespers, whilst I went on
walking with Dutrex. At ordinary times he is a man
of extreme reserve, fencing off his intimate soul, and
all the more unapproachable in proportion as he
becomes gayer; but to-day, as if in spite of himself,
he was a little expansive.</p>

<p>There had been a silence, and then he said:</p>

<p>“Just at this hour, coming from his office, my father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
has doubtless been greeted by the words, ‘Still no
news of the little one?’ I’m afraid I shall find them
greatly aged.”</p>

<p>“But, my dear fellow, they’ll get young again fast
enough when they see you!”</p>

<p>“I have a presentiment,” he suddenly exclaimed.
“Look out at the view before us, this dead countryside.
No smoke rises from Ingolstadt. There is not
a soul in the fields. Does not this suggest defeat?
Last Sunday there were still some men among the
idlers at the gate who came to stare at the French.
To-day there were only women and children. All their
men are at the front. And this wind from France! I
am sure that it is sweeping back their armies. I am
confident that just now, when we were drinking our
toasts, we were unwittingly celebrating a French
victory.”</p>

<p>He went on to speak of his family and of his studies.
The cold breeze stung our faces. A chill vapour was
floating across the melancholy plain, so that it seemed
as if all that we looked down upon was covered with
mysterious veils of crêpe. How sweet it was to me
to listen, in exile, to the delicately simple confidences
of this son of France.</p>

<p>When I re-entered the “salon,” Durupt, back from
vespers, was reading the German translation of a novel
by Sienkiewicz, <i>Mit Feuer und Schwert</i>. He turned
towards me with a dazed and yet decisive air: “Old
Riou, I have a presentiment of victory!”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="THE_VICTORY_OF_THE_MARNE">THE VICTORY OF THE MARNE</h2>

<p class="right"><i>September 28, 1914.</i></p>

<p>A batch of eighty-two convalescent wounded arrived
at the fort on the stroke of five. We thought at first
that they were ordinary prisoners sent here direct from
the last battle. We were already running to meet
them on the bridge, eager for trustworthy news, ready
to throw a fire of questions at the unexpected
messengers across the curtain of Bavarian bayonets.
Then we noticed that several of them were limping,
while others, though not limping, were leaning upon
sticks after the manner of old men, and we perceived
that they had all lost the bronzing of trench and camp
life. We were disappointed. These white-faced men
came from the hospitals of Ingolstadt, and such drafts,
as a rule, bring but little news.</p>

<p>While the transfer was being effected, and while
the two German non-commissioned officers, the one
belonging to the fort and the one belonging to the
town, paper and pencil in hand, ticked off their men as
sheep are counted at a market, we studied our
comrades’ appearance. They were not very ragged.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
They had almost completely repaired the terrible
havoc of battle.</p>

<p>The havoc of battle! These words have no meaning
to a fire-eater past the age for active service who fights
his battles among women. He speaks of the beauty of
the assault, of the heroism of a bayonet charge. All
that his imagination conceives is the richly dressed
shop-front of war. It would be different if he knew the
reality that lies behind! One must have been over
several battlefields immediately after the fighting in
order to understand the meaning of the phrase, “the
havoc of battle.”</p>

<p>“They throw away their shakos, their muskets, even
their colours,” writes Victor Hugo. Alas, dropping
with fatigue, some of them will even throw away their
coats. You see them in shirtsleeves, running across
the stubble. The firing gets hotter; suddenly a shell
bursts, and a man is wounded in three places—hit in the
back, scratched on the thigh, and deeply torn in the
arm. He falls. To make matters worse it begins to
rain. The ground soon becomes a slough. The battle
passes off into the distance. Rain continues. Night
comes. Our man, half drowned, and almost buried in
a furrow, no longer hears a sound. He tries to rise,
but finds it impossible. He strains his eyes to see
something. The effort is useless. He is glued to the
ground; he can see nothing beyond the tuft of grass
where his head is resting, nothing unless it be, close at
hand, the mist-wraiths which gradually surround him
and hide him. In anguish he cries: “Maman, maman!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
He believes himself lost. “Maman!” He screams this
with all his might. It is an appeal, a complaint, a
prayer. He is in pain. He is parched with thirst.
“Maman, maman!”</p>

<p>The stretcher-bearers have heard the cry. “The
ambulance!” they shout to reassure him, making a
speaking-trumpet of their hands. Here they are with
their red lamps knocking against their legs. A red
cross man takes our soldier on his back. The wounded
man groans. What can be done? They let him
groan. On the road is waiting a forage cart with
straw on the bottom. It creeks and jolts; it is a bed
of torture. It is packed with wounded. The rain
never ceases. Our man feels that he is dying of cold,
but he has the good luck to faint. The cart reaches
a dilapidated farm. Beside the entrance are two
lanterns, one white and the other red; it is the field
hospital.</p>

<p>As soon as its turn comes the blood-stained bundle
is smartly brought in and placed upon a truss of fresh
straw. Amid the horrible concert of lamentations the
man gradually returns to consciousness. What pain!
The chief hospital orderly comes by with his dark-lantern.
He examines the newcomer. “Here’s
another of them hit in the back,” he says with a growl.
He summons assistance, and two or three men painfully
turn the poor devil on to his face.</p>

<p>“Have you the scissors?”</p>

<p>“No, they are in use.”</p>

<p>“Have you a knife?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>“Here you are.”</p>

<p>Rip, rip. With two slashes the orderly removes the
back of the shirt. Rip, rip. He does the same with
the rest. But this is sticking to the wound. “Oh,
oh,” groans the patient. It is finished. The skin
is free.</p>

<p>“He has blood-stains on his trousers, too.” Rip, rip.
“Hullo! what a nasty tear in his thigh.” Rip, rip.
“Gently—how it sticks!” Half of the trousers, stiff
and black with blood, is thrown into the alley way to
join the other rags.</p>

<p>At last comes the turn of the shirtsleeve. This is an
easier job. Rip, rip.</p>

<p>“Monsieur le Major.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answers the medical officer, at work at the
other end of the barn. “Have you exposed the
wounds?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Monsieur le Major.”</p>

<p>Oh yes, they are fully exposed. So is the wounded
man! He had nothing on when he was brought in
beyond a shirt and trousers. Now his shirt lacks an
arm and most of the back, while his trousers have but
one leg! Poor devils, whom the panic of retreat and
the orderly’s knife have reduced to this condition.
Such men as these may well speak of “havoc.”</p>

<p>And if the field hospital is in the hands of the enemy,
the patients in this condition will have to endure two or
three days of railway travelling, slowly jolted along in
the foreigner’s cattle trucks.</p>

<p>Just now I was talking about our new comrades.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
They had known the extremity of wretchedness.
Two or three weeks had passed. There they were,
behind the curtain of Bavarian bayonets, standing on
their own feet, their clothing a little worn; but they
were full of pluck, and, considering everything, almost
gay. Doubtless a Frenchman might see reason for
surprise at their equipment, for this was somewhat
unusual. But no German could find anything to laugh
at; he could not but feel that he was looking at true
French soldiers. I was grateful to our comrades for the
spirit and ingenuity which had enabled them, by the
use of chance expedients, to assume a military, a
French aspect, under the eyes of the enemy. In
certain conditions, coquetry is heroic.</p>

<p>Dominating the troop was a gigantic chasseur
d’Afrique whose appearance drew the most indolent in
the fort to look at him. Seen close at hand, he was
simply a foot soldier of the 146th, from Toul, who had
cut himself a chéchia [elongated fez] out of a red trouser-leg.
Beside him was a dragoon, sporting an extremely
elegant police-cap manufactured from the same cloth.
A chasseur alpin partially concealed beneath his ample
cloak a perfectly new pair of greenish trousers, bought
from a sutler through the hospital gate at Ingolstadt.
A colonial infantryman of the 6th, from Tarare, who
had received a horrible wound in the shoulder, had a
linesman’s coat and an artilleryman’s trousers. It was
only his red-anchored képi, saved from the general
wreck, which revealed him to be a marine. I regret to
say that some of our warriors wore peaceful-looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
civilian caps of grey cloth which would have given an
unsoldierly appearance to Ney himself.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, this debris of broken regiments, rigged
out at haphazard as it arrived from the battlefield,
soiled, torn, and deplorable odds and ends collected
from the abandoned slaughter-houses and thrown pell-mell
into transport wagons, had now an appearance
that was far from being filthy or wretched. Besides,
the men were smiling.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the soldiers who come here direct
from the battlefield are far from smiling! Their brains
are filled with terrible visions. They anticipate
cunning tortures. They are astonished that their
throats have not yet been cut. I was struck by their
aspect as of hunted beasts when the gate of the fort
was opened wide to admit them.</p>

<p>I call to mind one of my comrades, an officer in the
medical service. His red cross armlet protected him.
Upon the roof of the field hospital he had with his
own hands conspicuously unfurled the great neutral
flag. I remember the circumstances perfectly. The
cannonade had ceased. Our ears, which for three
successive hours had been deafened by an infernal
noise, were astonished by this sudden, palpitating, and
immense silence. The men of our regiment, sent forward
on a bayonet charge across the open, had been
mowed down in masses. The survivors retreated in
headless, incoherent, almost indifferent groups. While
this was in progress I saw some of the men pause,
quietly strike the plum-trees with their rifles, fill their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
mouths and their pockets with the unripe fruit, and
continue on their way with the same careless gait as if
at manœuvres. But the Prussians were in hot pursuit.
We saw them advancing in regular order, close at hand,
at first in open formation, and subsequently by sections.
They halted, fired, bounded forward, fired again.
Repeatedly they fired upon our field hospital, where
the flood of bleeding flesh overflowed into the little
garden behind the house. Dzing, dzing. Their
bullets cannoned among our utensils, broke off limbs
from the little fruit trees shading our wounded, and
sometimes covered the poor hungry fellows with plum
branches.</p>

<p>The whole of our staff was at work, and the work
was overwhelming, utterly disproportionate to the
equipment and the personnel. Yet it was all the better,
for excessive labour blinds us to danger. When the
body is utterly exhausted, this reacts upon the mind,
which becomes dull and insensible, so that imagination is
paralysed. No doubt when, all of a sudden, quite close
to your ears, a passing bullet utters its sharp but gentle
flute-like note, the mind starts and rears like a
frightened horse. It is invaded by a flow of precise
and positive thoughts of self-preservation. But this is
for a moment only. The act upon which you are
engaged is mechanically finished, and there you are at
your post, just as before. Heroism? The word is too
lofty. It is better to say simply that action is a vice
which holds the mind in its powerful grip and prevents
reflection. In actual warfare, all ordinary men are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
worth pretty much the same; all are, as circumstances
vary, equally cowardly or equally courageous. But the
leaders are different. I am now of opinion that the
true leaders, those to whose troops panic is unknown,
are those who never abandon their men’s minds to
themselves even for a moment, who keep these minds
permanently occupied, concentrated upon the immediate
vision of some simple and direct action which has to be
performed.</p>

<p>“There’s no end to them,” said the hospital orderlies.
And indeed there seemed no end to them. The
wounded streamed in from all directions, in Indian file,
in groups, or in pairs helping one another along.
When the house was full we did not know where to put
them. For the time being we packed them together
outside, wherever there was a patch of shade. Poor
lads! already exhausted with hunger, fatigue, and loss
of blood, they had used up the last ounce of energy in
making for our flag. “Orderly,” they would say when
reaching the door, “do what you can for me!” Then,
out of breath, they would slowly sink to the ground,
with little cries like those of a sick child. More than
one of us, at sight of this, had to wipe his eyes furtively.</p>

<p>The firing had ceased. All at once some one cried:
“There they are!” A Prussian cyclist had in fact
ridden by the gate, followed by the first patrol. They
did no more than glance at the field hospital in passing.
At this moment I was about to open the surgical
instrument wagon to get something I needed. While
we were all so busy, the officer of whom I have spoken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
above was standing two paces from me, his arms hanging
by his sides. When he heard the words “There they
are,” he was dumbfounded. The brown hairs of his
thin beard were bristling on his pale skin. His cheeks
were blanched; he stared at vacancy. He swayed upon
his little legs. Having his back towards the gate he
had seen nothing. But he had heard the words, “There
they are.” He knew that he was about to be seized,
and he thought that his last hour had come. He stood
for two or three seconds, mute, pale, as if thunderstruck.
Then, talking to himself, he said tonelessly, “They’ll slit
all our throats!”</p>

<p class="tb">While the German <i>Feldwebel</i>, with Dutrex at his
elbow, conducts the convalescents to their rooms, section
by section, I return to the “salon,” and bury myself in
my papers. All at once the door is noisily opened, and
Dutrex, with his usual shortness of manner, insistently
martial, in a state of cheerful exhilaration, ushers in a
tiny man, corporal of the 146th of Toul. Shepherding,
hustling, dominating with his great blustering voice, he
pushes the stranger into my arms.</p>

<p>“Here’s a man for you!” I shake the little corporal’s
hand. The first downy growth of beard is appearing on
his face. The <i>juventa intonsa</i> of Euryalus. He has the
callow air of a candidate for university honours. With
thoughtful eyes, quietly obstinate behind glasses, he
resembles my friend Bonifas.</p>

<p>Durupt arrives. Several others, attracted to the spot,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
form a circle round us. As one man, the cooks desert
the “plutonic region”; Davit, the Hercules, and the
painstaking Devèse seat themselves unceremoniously
upon the ministerial table.</p>

<p>“Friend,” begins Dutrex, “we’ve brought you here
before Riou because you look intelligent, restrained,
judicious. Riou insists upon trustworthy news. Don’t
exaggerate when you are talking to him. If you are a
romancer, clear out!”</p>

<p>The little corporal smiles. I open the conversation
with the usual commonplaces, asking him about his
wound, where he was taken prisoner, his last battle, his
impression of the Germans at the hospital, his name,
what part of France he comes from. Then I put the
great question:</p>

<p>“Have you any news of the war?”</p>

<p>His name is Lahire. He comes from Paris. He
obviously has news of importance. In a quiet, rather
husky voice, speaking jerkily with intervals of silence,
he tells his tale simply.</p>

<p>“This morning,” he says, “at half-past seven, an
artillery lieutenant with a wound in the leg arrived at
the hospital. He still wore his sabre and his revolver,
for he had been granted the honours of war. His
coming made a great impression upon our little world
of wounded, causing much more stir than the recent
visit of the princess of Bavaria. In a trice every one
knew of his advent, and he immediately secured an
attentive audience.</p>

<p>“I must tell you that at the Ingolstadt hospital<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
officers and men live in close association. The officers,
who number about fifty, are all in the same ward; but
the rest of the ward, which is just like the others, is
occupied by the men.</p>

<p>“Thus, while the lieutenant was speaking to his
brother officers, we of the small fry gathered round
them in a second compact circle. He had opened one
of the last numbers of the <i>Bulletin des Armées de la
République</i>; he read out loud, and, above all, he made
comments as he read. He was bubbling over with
delight. His fort, a fort of the third class, which was
expected to hold out for thirty-six hours, had held out
for six days. Three thousand melinite shells had been
fired into the place. They would have resisted much
longer had not their guns been of such short range.
The fact is that, after they had broken up a German
division, they were forced to surrender, four hundred of
them, including fifty killed and a great number of
wounded. This happened on September 25th. Until
the surrender the fort was in communication with
Verdun. As you see, my news is recent.”</p>

<p>“But which fort was it?” I asked.</p>

<p>“The Camp des Romains to the south of St. Mihiel.”</p>

<p>“What! The Camp des Romains has fallen? But
in that case the Germans must have forced the Spada
gap. The Hauts-de-Meuse must have been taken!”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it! The Camp des Romains was taken
from the north-west, and its capture has been an empty
glory for the Germans. It is the fort of Paroches which
commands the bridges of the Meuse and the passage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
through Verdun, and they are not going to get this fort.
Be easy in your minds, Spada and the Hauts-de-Meuse
are all right. Better still, we have regained in the east,
in Lorraine and in Upper Alsace, all the positions of
the opening days of the campaign. We are at Château-Salins.”</p>

<p>“At Château-Salins? Are we then also at Dieuze?
My corps entered the place on August 19th and had to
vacate it the next day.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we are at Dieuze. In our batch there is a man
who was wounded at Dieuze on September 13th—I
think that was the date. This same day we took the
town, lost it, and retook it.”</p>

<p>“Are we also back at Thann?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and at Gwebwiller too.”<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>“What more did your lieutenant say?”</p>

<p>“He said that the disorder in France at the beginning
of September was intense, and that Paris had almost
abandoned hope at the news that the advance guard of
the Boches had entered Compiègne. Then energetic
measures were taken. A few days later, the Germans
lost two great battles: one at Meaux, where we took
60,000 prisoners, barely half of whom were wounded;
the other between Rheims and Craonne. Since then,
for more than a fortnight, hand-to-hand fighting has
been going on fiercely along the whole front. Their
right wing has been cut off. We have occupied the line<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
from St. Quentin through Charleroi to Namur. We
have effected a junction with the Belgian army, and are
closing in upon the Germans like a pair of scissors. We
speak of it as ‘Japanese tactics,’ le coup de Moukden,
and it seems that the coup has been successful. The
two blades of the scissors draw nearer day by day.
Everywhere the Boches are in retreat. Their front,
which was at Rheims, has now been pushed back sixty
kilometres from the town. We have entered Varennes.
We have made quick work of it to spue them into
Luxemburg and Prussia by way of the Moselle! Besides,
our government is back in Paris, and Poincaré
has been to London to visit George V.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>“Let me assure you that this lieutenant was in
earnest. He was not orating to his inferiors in order
to keep up their spirits. He was talking to officers,
among whom were several captains and men of higher
grade. He was absolutely confident of victory.”</p>

<p>Little Lahire was still talking in the quiet voice with
which he had opened. But we felt that he was animated
by a sombre and intense, though subdued fire. We
listened, mute and solemn. There is a keen joy which,
overflowing and submerging our individuality, suddenly
surges out to the utmost limits of our highest affections—family,
country, humanity, God. <i>Freude</i>, <i>Freude</i>,
sings the sublime chorus of the 9th symphony. Joy,
joy. But this joy is grave and heroic. A shiver goes
through your being, you are transfigured. You suddenly
feel your footing in the eternal, in the absolute.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
I said not a word. The little corporal of the 146th, his
eyes remaining cool behind his glasses, continued his
story. The circle of the audience pressed ever closer.
Unable to restrain my tears, I took his hand, said
“Thank you,” and hastened from the room.</p>

<p>Oh France, my France!</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="A_BREAKFAST">A BREAKFAST</h2>

<p class="right"><i>October 5, 1914.</i></p>

<p>Plenty!</p>

<p>I wake at twenty minutes to five, or, by French time,
twenty minutes to four. There is a glimmer of moonlight
in the casemate. The place looks like a fantastic
sawmill with piles of planks lying about on the floor.
The snores rise and fall rhythmically. However much
divided our prisoners may be by day (as divided as
men are in time of peace, and perhaps more so, for
intimate association emphasizes differences and accentuates
shocks), they, unknown to themselves, attain
harmony in sleep.</p>

<p>As you know, I find this harmony distasteful.
Moreover, for some time past, with the chill coming
of dawn a violent rheumatic pain in the loins has
rendered the recumbent position intolerable to me. I
determine to rise.</p>

<p>Moving gently, in order to avoid waking Guido,
who is an extremely light sleeper, I throw off my
coat, which has been tucked round my neck, and lay
it down to the right of my couch, close to my képi,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
which I have lately pressed into service at night as
a receptacle for the miscellaneous articles from my
pockets. At this moment I should have appeared to
you like a mummy, torso rolled up in the French
military rug, brown with a red stripe, and the rest of
the body, from the waist to the feet, tightly enveloped
in the Ingolstadt blanket, stamped with the royal arms.</p>

<p>It is quite a business to get rid of these wrappings,
for my straw is now mere chaff, and Bertrand, doubly
soft as a betrothed lover and as a Phocæan, has a
nose extremely sensitive to dust. Still recumbent, by
means of slow contortions from right to left I unswaddle
the upper part of my body. Then, sitting
with my back against the wall, I take off my nightcap—my
ancient nightcap, thoroughly impregnated
with the dirt of Lorraine and of Bavaria, as dirty
as Queen Isabel’s shift. (I sleep with it pulled well
down over the ears, to protect my head from the
chaff.) At length I rise to my feet. The second
wrapping, which confines the lower extremities, makes
me look like a man about to take part in a sack
race. I untie it at the hips. It falls to the ground
like a skirt. Now I am dressed. I fold up my two
rugs with infinite precaution and put them on the
top of my knapsack. Seated on this improvised
stool, I take off my night slippers and put on my
heavy military boots, delightfully supple since Devèse,
the cook-butcher, anointed them for me with a wonderful
preparation of beef marrow. Emptying my
képi of watch, pipe, tobacco, pipe-lighter, pocket-knife,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
purse, and handkerchief (the huge regulation
handkerchief), I stuff all these things into the pockets
of my trousers. It is done. Guido has not stirred;
he dreams misanthropically. Bertrand has not
sneezed; he dreams amorously. With catlike stealth,
képi on head, coat tucked beneath my arm, and
shouldering my two haversacks, respectively containing
my papers and the small articles of my kit, I
hasten to the kitchen. To my great surprise I find
the place lighted up.</p>

<p>That villain Marie, pipe in mouth, sticky, greasy,
smeared with blacks, alert as a fox-terrier just let
out for a run, is rummaging in his stoves. While I
was still dreaming he had shaken up from their
slumbers two others: Lambert, most devoted of men,
my good little Lambert; and a famished specimen
from the 6th corps, by trade a charcoal-burner in
the forest of Argonne, who would cut up an oak
for you in return for a piece of rancid bacon rind.
Yesterday evening there was not a scrap of wood in
the kitchen. Dutrex “rowed” the cooks about it.
But Marie, the wiliest of all the Normans in Normandy,
rose by moonlight. Where can he have
been? How, knowing not a word of German beyond
<i>nichts</i> and <i>ja</i>, did he manage to circumvent the
guard? Anyhow, axe in hand, Lambert and the
charcoal-burner are vigorously and noisily attacking
logs of pine. I am surprised. These logs have a
strong resemblance to the timber-shores of the outer
ditches. What has he been up to, this Marie!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>“Canaille!” Dutrex sometimes exclaims to him.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” says Marie cheerfully; “that’s the
only sort that knows how to live!”</p>

<p>In fact, he does know how to live. Always on the
go, doing little services for every one in turn, swapping
for chocolate the cigars which are given him,
reselling this chocolate retail, buying with the money
packets of tobacco and cigarettes, which he hawks for
halfpennies in the dark passage outside the kitchen—he
will find his way back to the valley of Auge
with a nest-egg.</p>

<p>But I fancy he will get rid of some of it on the
way. “Just think of it, you fellows,” he frequently
exclaims. “‘Mézidon, fifty minutes’ stop!’ I tumble
to the ground. I put away the first bottle of Calvados
[cider brandy] I can get hold of. Then,
‘Lisieux, fifty minutes’ stop!’ Won’t it be splendid
to get a little good Norman stuff into one’s guts,
after the ditch-water of Fort Orff! One will get
home to the missus thoroughly cheerful.”</p>

<p>This Marie is a delight to me. Our philosophies
differ considerably. He has no pity, he says, for
lame ducks. But he has such keen vision, he is so
spirited and plain-spoken, and he is so original in
his methods of expression, that he is above criticism.</p>

<p>While Lambert and the charcoal-burner (his name
is Deschênes and he has been through two campaigns
in Morocco) are apportioning for the stoves
the spoils of Marie’s raid, I empty on to the table
the second of my haversacks. I wash and shave.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
Marie pours me out half a pint of steaming coffee.
“<i>Ja, ja</i>,” he says, as he adds a lump of sugar, smiling
his mischievous and knowing smile. <i>Ja</i>, in his vocabulary,
signifies everything that is good; <i>nichts</i>, on
the other hand, denotes everything that is bad.
This done, he returns to the plutonic region.</p>

<p>Then, in the blessed solitude of the “salon,” by the
pale and smoky light of the distant lamp and of the
dawn, I withdraw from the manuscript haversack
the packet about which I fancy I have been
dreaming all night.</p>

<p>You will think me very materialistic, I fear. But
as you read, bear in mind that I am extremely
well, that I am working as hard as usual, and that
my appetite, with which you are acquainted, has
to be satisfied here with a daily allowance that in
Paris would barely have sufficed for a single
meal.</p>

<p>It was Fritz Magen, the <i>Gefreiter</i>, the leading
private of our Bavarian guard, who gave me this
parcel yesterday evening. I had no thought of such
a windfall. In the same mood as any other prisoner,
I was waiting like the rest in No. 17 at the foot of
my “bed” for the brisk appearance in the casemate
of the men to take the roll-call.</p>

<p>It is half-past eight. Suddenly the door opens.
“The roll-call,” bellows Dutrex, bursting in gustily,
followed by the <i>Feldwebel</i> and the lantern-bearer.
Dutrex rapidly counts us. “<i>Zweiundzwanzig</i>,” he
announces to the <i>Feldwebel</i>. “Twenty-two.” He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
shakes me by the hand, saying: “<i>Gute Nacht, mein
Freund; schlafe wohl.</i>” The round passes on.</p>

<p>But Magen, the rear-guard, about to shut the door,
lays down his lantern, produces a good-sized box,
and thrusts it into my hands in a manner that is
almost timid. “<i>Da</i>,” he explains to me in German,
“my wife sent me a hamper this morning.”—“Oh,
thanks,” I reply. But he hastens off with his lantern
to join the <i>Feldwebel</i> in No. 18.</p>

<p>Greatly touched by this unexpected mark of friendship,
I turn to Guido. We tell over the contents
of the box. Five apples; two walnuts; a piece of
thick pancake, smelling of the <i>gnädige Frau</i> Magen’s
frying-pan; and half a bilberry tart! What luck!
Monsieur Magen, Bavarian as you are, you are a
brother, <i>ein Bruder</i>, a true comrade! I love you! I
give Guido his share. I put mine away in the haversack
of papers. I go to sleep to the thought that
to-morrow, instead of the wretched thin coffee with
rye and barley bread, I shall have a succulent fruit
breakfast. This thought immediately transports me
to Dully, to Fontainebleau, to Lablachère. But
what is there that does not transport me there,
visions of longing and of hope?</p>

<p>Thus it is that to-day, at earliest dawn, slowly
pacing the deserted “salon,” I make the first good
breakfast since my imprisonment.</p>

<h2 id="THE_FIRST_LETTER">THE FIRST LETTER</h2>

<p class="right"><i>October 8, 1914.</i></p>

<p>Yesterday the rumour was current, derived, it was
said, from the guard, that we were going to be permitted
to write to our families. A similar report has
stirred the fort two or three times before, but has
hitherto always proved false. Consequently the pessimists
and all the disciples of Heraclitus and the Porch—headed
by Guido—had a fine time of it in the casemates
making fun of the comrades who were jubilantly
commenting on the news.</p>

<p>On the glacis, at three o’clock, I met Sergeant
Feutrier walking with Corporal Heuyer.</p>

<p>“Riou,” observed the sergeant, “it’s the first fine day
of our imprisonment!”</p>

<p>“No, no, my friend,” I said, half-heartedly aping
Guido’s pessimism, “it is raining.” It was, in fact,
drizzling; the sopping grass spirted as we trod. But
Heuyer answered:</p>

<p>“Don’t tease Feutrier to-day; he is too happy.”</p>

<p>That evening, when I was working as usual at my
side of the table, I was deluged with requests: “Riou,
could you lend me your pen and ink?”—“Can you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
spare a sheet or two of paper?” There was a regular
procession of them. The mere thought, or rather the
conviction, that they would be able to write home transfigured
them. Home, the fireside! The loved ones,
the familiar objects, the birthplace, the motherland!
From this secret universe, at ordinary times deep
buried beneath the surface of their minds, but suddenly
exposed by the delvings of hope, there arose a
powerful incense which intoxicated them all. What
will they feel like at the prospect of going home, if
the still dubious possibility of writing can arouse such
an outburst of cheerful excitement?</p>

<p>Even the cooks, more practised in criticism than
the other prisoners, had lost all sense of proportion.
They handled their utensils with a terrible joy. Then
the tumult was stilled. A gentle atmosphere of harmony
hovered over the stoves. The cooks were silent
and motionless.</p>

<p>O memories! Sweet images in which our love of
life subsists and is fulfilled. Sweet images which, at
night, in the gloom and fatigue of the camp, make us
weep silent tears. Sweet images which, when death
threatens, rise suddenly in our minds and maintain
themselves, bringing benediction, the sole realities
amid the void, very angels of God!</p>

<p>Suddenly the plutonic region burst into melody:</p>

<p>The cooks, like every one else, were bewitched with
thoughts of France. For France they forgot the most
serious of their immediate duties. One was allowed
an entrance into the secret universe of their thoughts,
as if into a public place.</p>

<p>In the evening, when the roll-call was finished and
the round was leaving with the <i>Feldwebel</i> and our new
Bavarian sergeant, only just recovered from a wound in
the foot received at Lunéville, Dutrex made eyes at
me, and uttered the single word, “Oui.” I went to
sleep with the certainty that the news was true.</p>

<p>To-day every one has spent the morning in writing
<i>his</i> letter, the one and only letter to which we are
entitled. But what a disappointment! No more than
one company is to be allowed to send letters each day.
We are five companies. Only one letter every five days!<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>But that melancholy barrier of silence which for a
month and a half has separated us from the world has
at last been broken down!</p>

<p>It is true that we have been ordered to say nothing
about the war, and to instruct our correspondents to
observe a similar restriction. This morning these <i>Verboten</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
have disturbed us little. Do you think any one of
the prisoners, when writing his letter, had a fancy for
dissertations upon strategy? His wife, his fiancée, his
children, his mother, his whole life, were before his
eyes. At length people would know that he was alive!
His head was singing with voices from his own fireside.
He was intoxicated—at once giddy with excitement,
softened, bitter, almost mad. The most indifferent, the
most torpid, seemed to have been awakened with a
start. Permission to write, the act of writing, had
shaken them out of their inertia.</p>

<p>For, fortunately, imprisonment dulls our sensibilities.
At first it causes poignant suffering; and suffering, of
whatever kind, sharpens the faculties. But imprisonment
is above all hunger, chronic hunger. Those only
who have experienced it can understand the effect
which chronic hunger speedily exercises even upon an
active brain. At first it induces hallucinations. With
terrible realism the sufferer recalls meals eaten before
the war some particular dinner, such and such a picnic.
The nerves of taste and smell, exasperated by the scanty
regimen, are visited by memories of odours and tastes.
The man thinks of nothing but eating. Literally he is
nothing but a clamorous stomach. He will lie awake
the entire night thinking only of this: What can I do
to-morrow morning to secure a supplementary loaf?</p>

<p>Little Brissot, my friend of the Alpine infantry, when
we were walking a few days ago with our two French
medical officers, made this unexpected confession:
“Only one thing can give me pleasure now—to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
food. Only one man interests me—the man who is
capable of getting me food.”</p>

<p>This calm declaration from one so highly cultured
that he will distract his mind from the cares of important
business by reading James and Bergson, from
one intimately acquainted with Montaigne and the
Lake poets, seemed to us neither paradoxical, nor
irrelevant, nor cynical.</p>

<p>Among those who are able, by illicit and extremely
laborious methods, to procure food from outside, there
are few who do not seize their opportunity.</p>

<p>Men will try to get a thorough chill, hoping to be
sent to the infirmary, where they usually receive double
rations. Yesterday two prisoners, one of them a corporal,
fainted from hunger. Quite a number are so
weakened by want of food that they can no longer
climb the staircases leading to the courts and to the
slopes. When we heard just now that in the neighbouring
fort, Fort Hartmann, one of the prisoners had
hanged himself, the same thought ran through all our
minds: “The epidemic has begun, and will speedily
spread to our own prison.”</p>

<p>Ultimately, however, people grow accustomed to
short commons. Their activities, in some cases at
least, gradually become accommodated to their regimen.
In the long run, physical and mental life are reduced to
nil. The man hardly suffers, and he no longer revolts.</p>

<p>Even in the bravest the soldier-spirit dies. Look at
these men crouching on their heaps of straw hour after
hour, silent and half asleep; or look at them as with hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
in pockets and hanging heads they slowly make their way
up the slopes; who can imagine that these are the
men who fought like lions at Montcourt and Lagarde?</p>

<p>These sudden visions of home were requisite to
restore many of our prisoners, though but for a
moment, to life. But for how many of them this has
also involved a revival of suffering.</p>

<p>“I don’t know how I shall be able to feed my
three children next year unless I can get home soon.
I can’t help thinking about my farm, where the harvests
of corn and of grapes have been so poorly gathered,
and where everything is running to waste!” The
soldier who spoke thus comes from Uriage, in Dauphiné.
He stopped me when I was walking with measured
steps after the seven o’clock coffee, taking my
anti-rheumatic constitutional on the slopes. He drew
me aside into a corner of the fortifications. Taking a
letter from his pocket, he modestly asked me in a
melancholy tone: “Could you tell me if that is all
right, and whether you think it will be allowed to
pass? Please be good enough to read it. You have
my leave.” Poor comrade! It cut me to the heart
to see him. He wanted to look self-possessed, to look
like a man. But he had been weeping. He spoke low
and quietly in order to keep the tears out of his voice.
The paper shook in his hand. I read: “My dear
Marguerite.…” There was nothing in the letter.
“Don’t worry about me.… All is well with me.… We
are very well cared for.…” These reassuring
phrases were reiterated throughout the four pages, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
very words repeated again and again. My master, Jean
Monnier, declares that repetition is the rhetorical flower
of simple minds. What a tragedy underlay the disjointed
prose. This prisoner of war whose eyes shone
with hunger, this hollow-cheeked man who had spent
all his poor pocket-money so that he could no longer
buy any smuggled goods—bread, sugar, or chocolate—wrote:
“All is well with me,” “We are very well cared
for.” He said it and resaid it monotonously throughout
the entire letter. It was essential that his wife should
have no doubt about the matter, his poor wife who had
already so much trouble to bear. I should have liked
to pet him like a little brother, this man already grey.</p>

<p>I also wrote <i>my</i> letter. Having too much to say, I
said nothing. What are words when the heart hungers
for material presence, for a touch, for a living silence?
My letter was not even of the regulation length.</p>

<p>At eleven Guido came in, with his eternal rug round
his shoulders. He planted himself in front of my table.
He fixed me with his eye, the cold, distrustful eye of
the mountain dweller and of the priest. Then, making
up his mind to open his thin lips, he said:</p>

<p>“You are in a gloomy mood. You have been writing
to <i>her</i>.”</p>

<p>We went out together. I felt his harsh sympathy as
he strode by my side. Every one was out of doors, but
there were very few groups. Each man walked by
himself, rapt in his own visions. Guido remarked:</p>

<p>“It’s extraordinary how little noise they make,
eleven hundred warriors!”</p>

<p class="right"><i>October 15, 1914.</i></p>

<p>The happiest moment in the day is in the early
morning, when I leave the sleeping casemate. On
the staircases, the lamps are flickering to extinction.
The passages, always dark, are filled with the stench
from the latrines and with what is sometimes termed
a “poor smell.” I make a hasty toilet in the kitchen;
take my half-pint of coffee from one of the steaming
cauldrons; gulp it down without straining it, Turkish
fashion; don my coat and my green cap; mount the
stairs leading to the upper courts. At length I am out
of doors.</p>

<p>Dawn, fresh air, solitude!</p>

<p>This morning I was in a frisky mood. Life seemed
good. The cold was biting. The white frost endowed
the simplest objects with a Christmas purity. I walked
smartly along the broad path which surmounts the
escarp. When we arrived at the fort, this path, like the
other parapets, was covered with moss and turf; but
now, through our continual walking on it, the grass has
been worn away. It has become a road.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>Though I am a sociable creature, and delight in
company, I find it extraordinarily pleasurable to be
alone. I need long hours all to myself. In Paris,
at Dully, at Lablachère, I never weary of my workroom,
where I see no one before luncheon. The
mornings are always too short. I don’t know if I
ought to regard it as an obsession, but here, when I
have been walking for an hour immersed in thoughts
and memories, in solitary enjoyment of the quiet northward
landscape of fields and forests, my first encounter
with a man causes me real discomfort. I cannot be
agreeable before midday.</p>

<p>First of all, I made my clandestine and customary
visit to your acacias. They grow at the highest point
of our domain. A look-out is hidden here. I had long
been familiar with a kind of large metal hood which
interrupts the long grass for a moment, and projects
barely a span above the surface of the soil. Yet
had it not been for a recent adventure of two of the
prisoners, Noverraz and Laloux, I should never have
dreamed that this was a strategic eye, the eye of
the fort.</p>

<p>Last Wednesday the men of the heavy artillery were
engaged in their final practice before leaving for the
Russian front. The idea was that Fort Orff was being
attacked by an enemy hidden in Kösching wood, and
suddenly appearing to the north of the fort. The object
of the defence was to check the onslaught. Stationed
to the southward, between Orff and Ingolstadt, near
Lenting, the gunners were firing over us, the line of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
fire almost touching the parapets of the fort. It need
hardly be said that, by special order, all access to the
parapets had been forbidden from nine till three, while
the manœuvres were in progress. The guns thundered;
the weather was fine; how dull it seemed, even to
men whose legs were weakened from hunger, to be
penned in the casemates! At ten o’clock the Protestant
service was held. Crowds attended it, so that
it was necessary to open both wings of the door, and
thus to include in the chapel a gloomy passage which
leads up to it. But what was there to do after service?
The few who are usually energetic enough to play at
prisoners’ base, leapfrog, or some other lively game, in
the east court, were itching to be out. The ration
snatchers, those who, in the dark corridors, armed
with a sharp knife, surreptitiously hack a steak from
the passing joint, and those who, when the vegetables
are being prepared, filch a turnip or a potato, longed
for their open-air kitchens, hastily installed during the
intervals between the rounds. The carvers and polishers,
who sell pebbles fashioned into képis or into spiked
helmets, or simply decorated with the Bavarian arms,
sighed for the pleasures of their trade. The whole
fortress was heavily uneasy. But who would care to
take the risk of going out? The orders issued that
morning had been peremptory.</p>

<p>But the cannonade continued, and my friends
Noverraz and Laloux, being non-combatants (one is
a musician and the other a doctor of medicine), were
naturally lovers of military displays. Unable to endure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
any longer the pharmaceutical aroma of the consulting
room, they abandoned the place to Badoy, who, left
alone, gave himself up to a profound fit of home-sickness.</p>

<p>Beneath the sombre arches our adventurers go to and
fro, exploring the ant-hill. All at once, having entered
an unknown region, they discover a narrow staircase.
They mount it. It leads to a revolving cupola. What
luck! Through the peep-hole in the armoured wall it is
possible for them to examine the whole of our northern
horizon, right up to the wood. Upon the ploughs, the
meadows, and the clover fields, the heavy projectiles
from the 21-centimetre guns are falling incessantly.
The earth shakes under their impact. Plumes of
white smoke, like those emitted by burning straw,
rise from the soil. Sometimes, in the clear atmosphere,
they can distinguish the actual flight of the
projectiles. But the imaginary columns of the assault
are drawing nearer. The fire of percussion shells
ceases; crackling shrapnel shells take their place.
They pass from twenty to fifty yards above the
glacis, great balls of dense smoke, from which are
emitted in all directions smaller balls, a rain of
satellites, which fly to pieces in their turn with the
rattling noise of bullets.</p>

<p>Our two red cross men are absorbed in this scene,
which lies almost at their feet, when the German
quartermaster comes in. Red with wrath, swearing
like a cabdriver, he seizes them by the arm, hurls
them down the iron stairway, and installs himself in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
their place. Crestfallen, but at bottom thoroughly well
pleased at having enjoyed the sight, they return to the
consulting-room to rejoin Badoy and his home-sickness.</p>

<p>This little exploit filled the whole fort with glee.</p>

<p class="tb">From the look-out this morning, or let us say from
your acacias, the country was exquisitely beautiful.
The position of the valleys was indicated by diaphanous
bands of blue vapour. They rose softly as
far as the border of the pines and vanished there.
Birds flew through the silent air, shining in the sunlight.
I heard the ploughmen crying “<i>hue</i>” to their
horses. Beyond the oak coppice which adjoins the
glacis on the Wegstetten side, a great herd of oxen
was grazing.</p>

<p>All at once a company of Bavarian soldiers appeared
upon the military road from behind the eastern
redoubt. The men, recruits of the 1914 class, clad
in blue tunic, and drill trousers tucked into their boots,
bore no arms. They sang loudly as they marched,
scanning the rhythm:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Lieb’ Vaterland, magst ruhig sein,</div>
<div class="verse">Fest steht und treu die Wacht am Rhein!<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Half way up the incline, between the forest and
the fort, they halted. The captain, without dismounting,
made them a speech. From a distance it sounded
like barking. He stressed his syllables so vigorously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
that fragments reached my ears notwithstanding the
distance. The word <i>Heimat</i>, home, came again and
again, like a refrain. Then they intoned the national
anthem:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Heil dir im Siegerkranz,</div>
<div class="verse">Herrscher des Vaterlands!<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>They began to manœuvre. The company broke
into two parts. One section took up a position in the
bushes in front of the wood. The other section went
back along the road as far as the glacis, to the oak
coppice. The men stood there for a moment. A fat
sergeant, the only one wearing the grey-blue uniform
of active service, signed to them to fire at me. I could
clearly make out his head, set upon a short, thick neck
like that of a pig. He made gestures to signify his
hostility. I shrugged my shoulders. Then his section,
turning away from me, advanced in open formation
across the ploughed fields, making as though to attack
the men in the bushes.</p>

<p>I ran down the steep slope. A footpath I am fond
of runs along it half way up. Were it not for the
high wall of the escarp rising parallel with the grassy
counterscarp, it would be possible to believe oneself
in a peaceable valley in the open country. Here and
there, beside the footpath, a few trees are growing—a
young oak, stunted and gnarled, some dwarf poplars,
a raspberry bush, a hawthorn. Across the ditch,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
capping the masonry and hiding the view of the plain,
is the grassy covering of the first glacis, thickly set
with wild rose-trees reddened with hips and haws,
and displaying at intervals the silver and golden tints
of beautiful little birches. Beyond the two slopes
there is nothing to be seen, nothing but the sky.
This morning the blue was of a tender liquid tint. At
a great altitude tiny clouds were visible, blushing in
the dawn.</p>

<p>I never go along this footpath without thinking of
my friends de Bavier. I picture myself pacing the steep
banks of the Dullive beneath the great dome of the
trees. I sit upon my favourite bench. I look at the
cool moss on the wheels of the abandoned watermill.
Beneath the shifting shade of the beeches and the
alders, I listen to the gurgle of the water as it flows
over the stones.</p>

<p>This morning I seemed to be in a land of faery.
Beneath every dwarf poplar the footpath and the
turf were carpeted with yellow leaves, speckled with
black, already decaying, and exhaling a penetrating
odour of mouldering vegetation. It seemed to me
that all the life of my holidays, all the faithful and
pure friendship which, since adolescence, has never
ceased to surround me at Dully, all the faces and
the voices of this beloved house, were coming to me
with the autumn vapours, rising from among the first
masses of dead leaves.</p>

<p class="tb">At seven o’clock I was seated at my table. I found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
a note from the sergeant of our Bavarian guard, the
man who was wounded at Lunéville. It was his
farewell.</p>

<p>Yesterday evening he had called me into the
guardroom.</p>

<p>“Where are you going?” I asked, when he told me
that he was leaving. “Are they sending you to the
front?”</p>

<p>“I think so. I am recalled to Kösching to join my
regiment.”</p>

<p>“How far is Kösching?”</p>

<p>“About a league. The recruits are billeted there.”</p>

<p>“Does your wound still hurt you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, at night.”</p>

<p>He had given me his chair, and was sitting upon the
wood of the smaller platform. He was a young fellow
of twenty-five, with regular features, blue eyes, and fair
hair cut very short. A fine, downy growth on his rosy
cheeks made him look younger. I know little about
him. He told me that he lived near Munich, forty kilometres
from here. One day when he saw me at work,
your photograph made him break his reserve for a
moment.</p>

<p>“Is that your <i>Geliebte</i>?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“For my part, I also was about to be betrothed.
But the war has dashed my hopes.”</p>

<p>He said no more. I lacked courage to question him.
I understood from the first that this handsome fellow,
born for happiness, harboured a secret grief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>Yesterday evening we were for the most part silent.
Through the loopholes came the last rays of the
setting sun, lighting up the orderly row of rifles in
the arm-rack. In the shadow, on the great platform
which filled half the room, two Landwehr men were
sleeping. My friend Foch, the infantry sergeant,
seated on a broached cask, was draining mugs of beer
amid a noisy circle of Bavarians. In our corner a
pensive peace reigned. My host was preparing me
a slice of bread spread with minced meat. I sipped
my beer slowly, after the French manner. Then he
drew from his haversack a long and thin cigar,
pierced by a straw. Handing it to me, he said:
“Smoke that, for you like strong tobacco. It is an
Austrian cigar, sent me from home.” We said hardly
anything more. He speaks but little French, and my
German is not very good. All that we knew was that
we were happy to be there together.</p>

<p>He has gone now. In four or five days he will be
under fire once more.</p>

<p>This is the feast day of the Queen of Bavaria, the
<i>Theresientag</i>.</p>

<p>“Did you hear the bells?” asked Durupt, when I
entered the kitchen. “The sound came from every
quarter this morning. It gave me an uneasy feeling.
As I passed through Coblenz they were ringing madly
for Manonviller.”</p>

<p>When remounting the slopes I had indeed heard the
bells, and had noted with surprise that the blue-and-white
Bavarian standard was floating over the fort;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
but meeting Guido outside room 32, I learned from
him that it was the <i>Theresientag</i> and I was therefore
able to reassure Durupt. The vegetables were now
being prepared.</p>

<p>“No more news, no more papers, no more enthusiasm—it
suggests the deluge!” says Labassan, a light-hearted
fellow, all goitre and paunch, ever playing the
fool, nicknamed l’Asticot (the maggot). He peels his
potato with inimitable gestures which set the whole
circle in fits.</p>

<p>Among them is Bonin, a Parisian, of the 31st of the
line, the 31st half-brigade of Valmy, my regiment.
On August 24th, at Longuyon in Meurthe-et-Moselle,
he was wounded in the face, a bullet passing
in at one cheek and out at the other. I am very fond
of this little workman of the Marais quarter; his clear
and quiet eyes radiate patriotism and good sense.</p>

<p>“Give me a match,” says Loupe, who wears the long
white cap of the German “Michael,” its tassel dangling
over his ear. With deliberation he lights his great
china pipe, adorned with a view of Ingolstadt. Then,
having rolled a spill of paper, he asks: “Who wants
a light?” He goes the round of the circle, offering
his burning spill. “‘<i>Et quasi cursores vitai lampada
tradunt</i>,’” he quotes. “Freely translated, ‘Matches are
scarce!’” For Loupe is lettered.</p>

<p>“Ah, my poilus,” says a homely fellow of the 26th,
a man sturdy as an oak, “it is plain enough that, with
all these Maccabees about, the crows will have a fat
time of it. They’ll breed like rabbits! But we may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
hope that after a while there will come the season
of the lean kine. When there’s no more human food,
they’ll be forced to eat one another.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry about the crows,” rejoins a red
cross man from Rheims. “It is we who are starving.
Some of our men here actually turn over the kitchen
refuse to find food!”</p>

<p>Our rations are indeed dwindling. This morning
the quartermaster delivered to the kitchen staff so
scanty an allowance of coffee and roasted barley that
it hardly served to darken the water in our eight
cauldrons. On Sunday each man had to be content
with 1⅓ oz. of semolina at midday, and with ⅔ oz. of
vermicelli in the evening. And what are we to think
of this heap of potatoes on the ground at my feet? Is
it intended to feed five hundred men, or one section
merely? And to-day is the <i>Theresientag</i>! Really,
matters begin to look serious. It is hardly an
exaggeration to say “We are starving!” Who is
responsible? Who has made up his mind to turn
the fort into a hunger camp? It is certainly not the
commandant, a thorough gentleman, kind-hearted,
courteous, and just. Who then? Perhaps the quartermaster,
an ill-bred Upper Franconian, cross-grained,
obstinate as a mule, but whom I should have thought
too stupid to be a cheat, is feathering his nest by giving
us short allowance. Or is it possible that the ultra-orthodox
Monsieur de Hertling, philosopher and prime
minister of Bavaria, has made up his mind to starve the
prisoners of “the infidel and perverse nation”?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>Enter Marie and d’Arnoult. The former, cleared
unceremoniously out of the kitchen because his traffic
in articles of food became too notorious, is brandishing
the censer from the chapel. The requiem mass is
about to be said, and on this occasion the old curé
of Lenting is to officiate, assisted by nine of our
comrades, soldier-priests. The extemporized sacristan
has no tongs; crouching before the stove, he is
endeavouring with finger and thumb to remove the
hot coals destined a few minutes hence to burn incense
before the flesh and blood of Christ.</p>

<p>D’Arnoult, of the 6th mounted chasseurs (known in
the fort simply as “le Chasseur”), is Major von Stengel’s
secretary. He takes his seat by my side. Having
read the papers, he is able to inform me that in France
the 15th class is to be called up on November 2nd. He
relates that the Russians seem inclined to repeat with
the Germans the tactics successfully employed against
Napoleon: to entice them far into the interior, where
they will perish of cold and hunger; to harass them
unceasingly by threatened attacks; to break up their
forces into incoherent fragments, and then to overwhelm
these isolated detachments in detail amid the snows.</p>

<p>The men at work on the vegetables were listening.</p>

<p>“We are likely, then, to stay here for some time,”
said one of them.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” says Bonin; “we are better off than
we should be at Augsburg. In the Ingolstadt hospital
I had a talk with some of the men from the Lechfeld
camp. There, I gathered, the prisoners sleep under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
canvas, mixed higgledy-piggledy with the wounded
who are awaiting removal to hospital. There are no
plates. They feed by sections, out of a trough. No
meat. Nothing but turnips and red cabbage. Not
very pleasant, this starvation camp, during the cold
winter rains. They would regard our fortress as the
lap of luxury!”</p>

<p>The potatoes have been peeled. Now for the turnips.
The soldiers cut slices and chew them raw while they
are at work. Poor devils!</p>

<p>The task is done. They sweep up the peelings.
How limp are their movements! To think that they
are all men between twenty and thirty years of age.
The Lenting curé told us in one of his sermons:
“You have been welcomed here as friends.” Major
von Stengel hit the mark more aptly one Sunday.
Apropos of the fact that all through the week, from
matins to compline, the religious services had been
diligently said, he remarked: “Sie würden lieber etwas
mehr Brot haben, als so viele christliche Seelensorge.”<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>But d’Arnoult has kept his principal item of news for
a tit-bit. A man named Schieder, one of the two
grocers of Hepperg, house number 31, jealous at finding
that his trade rival was exclusively patronized for the
clandestine purchases made on our behalf by the
soldiers of the guard, has just written a furious letter to
Commanding Officer Major Baron von Stengel. His
first complaint is that the commandant’s boot-cleaning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
orderly has insulted his (the commandant’s) wife,
“going to the length of making indecent and public
observations upon the imperfections of her face and
figure—conduct unworthy of the German army and the
German name.” The letter proceeds: “Further, it is
an open secret that the aforesaid orderly returns daily
from the village of Hepperg laden with a huge bundle
of rolls, sticks of chocolate, boxes of cigarettes and of
cigars, not to mention butter, sausages, smoked ham,
and roast goose—conduct even more scandalous, if
possible, than the insults offered to your honoured lady,
for it transforms into an abode of bliss a national
fortress where it is intended that the petulant pride of
the French should experience salutary suffering.” The
worthy grocer, in order to give vent to his spleen, had
pirated all the grandiloquence he could find in the
local papers. It was extremely laughable. But
d’Arnoult and I saw another side as well as the amusing
one. Were we to be cut off from our extra supplies?
The commandant had already summoned his <i>Wichser</i>,
and after administering a temperate reprimand, had
forbidden him to revisit Hepperg. Without losing his
head, Georg (we, his patrons, speak of him thus
familiarly) pointed out to the <i>Herr Major</i> that it
was necessary to go somewhere for his honour’s
marketing. “You will go to Kösching!”—“At your
orders, <i>Herr Major</i>, but Kösching is an hour’s walk!”—“Very
well, you will go to Kösching for three days;
Hepperg is out of bounds for three days!”</p>

<p>Le Chasseur concluded by saying: “But after all,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
I am convinced that the commandant will let the
matter drop. This laborious letter reeks too much of
the counter. Von Stengel has no fancy to see his
gentility contaminated by association with the greasy
scales of Schieder the grocer!”</p>

<p>It is already ten o’clock. I shall hardly get any
more work done to-day. The “salon” is becoming a
forum. My comrades are very good. They say: “I
don’t want to bother you. I’ve only just looked in to
shake hands.” But they ask for news; they give me
their own; they retail the latest canard. There is
always a canard in the fort. To-day, for example, the
talk in the courtyards is that the Russians have taken
Breslau. To pay the Germans out for the famous
<i>Paris kaput</i>, those of us who are least able to speak
German do not hesitate to greet the gentle Stheer, the
assistant quartermaster, with a cheerful “<i>Breslau kaput</i>.”
Naturally I protest, for the news is too utterly
ridiculous. So here I am sketching a map of the
military operations. Dutrex breaks off his reading of
Ibsen’s <i>John Gabriel Borkmann</i> to quote the latest
issues of the <i>Münchener</i>. Durupt mingles his invincible
hope with the debate. It is interminable!
And my poor studies lie neglected.</p>

<h2 id="I_HAVE_A_PALLIASSE">I HAVE A PALLIASSE</h2>

<p class="right"><i>October 17, 1914.</i></p>

<p>When I went out at seven o’clock there was a mist.
It had the same smell, piquant and wholesome, as at
Dully. The landscape was Japanese. I could have
imagined myself looking at the right-hand kakemono
in the drawing-room which gives on to the conservatory.
The pretty village of Hepperg, brought
near by a curious optical illusion, was stumped out
in a long silhouette in the background, a delicate
piece of filigree work seen through the soft, silky
vapour. Here and there in the foreground crows
made rich black markings. It was exquisite. There
was no one else on the parapets. I walked for some
time along the northern rampart. It was impossible
to have too much of this autumn morning.</p>

<p>Two or three images rose to my mind. Chief of
all was that of a walk in the Bois which we made
just at the last with Guite, to talk about you. A
thick mist was hovering over the lake. Invisible
boats passed to and fro. Their lanterns were like
large red moons gliding softly through the darkness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
The island was illuminated; strains of music floated
across to us. We were seated near the water. Close
at hand was a tree, bending over and dipping its
long locks into the lake. It recalled Hokusai’s
pictures. Next day I was to leave for Trouville.</p>

<p>It is strange. I had forgotten my captivity. I had
forgotten the war, the battlefields of Lorraine, Belgium,
and Poland. I had forgotten the terrible nights spent
upon the bloody field of Kerprich. As I looked at
the slender steeple of Hepperg church rising above
the morning mist-wreaths, the only visions I had were
those of a world at peace. The little yellowing birches
on the slopes had transported me to Dully. The
splendid purples of the oaks at la Lignière, the ruddy
golden tints of the horse-chestnut avenue, the Virginia
creeper garlanding with vermilion the windows of
the house, and all the familiar noises of this corner
of earth where I have spent so many sweet and
happy autumns—filled with these visions, I looked
and listened with rapture.</p>

<p>But little by little the sun had dispersed the mist.
The slopes were thronged with prisoners. Their
groups formed bright spots of colour in the pearly
light. A sort of calm languor, of slow and melancholy
serenity, seemed to have passed from nature
into their hearts and their gestures.</p>

<p>The sunlight was so sweet that I had delayed upon
the ramparts beyond my usual hour. When I went
indoors again I brought with me a bouquet of
autumn leaves—the leaves of your poplars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>“What on earth are you going to do with that?”
cried Ancey Redbeard, whom we tease here because he
looks like a Bavarian.</p>

<p>Le Second stood beside him, engaging little Le
Second, the designer to Poiret, the costumier. He
answered for me:</p>

<p>“Riou, at length you will help me to get even
with this wretch of an Ancey. He makes fun of
me because I pick flowers. There will be two of us
now to scrub his German hide for him!”</p>

<p>I filled my pipe and was about to set to work,
when Ploss, the German quartermaster, commonly as
rough as a bulldog, came in and seized me by the
arm, saying:</p>

<p>“I have a palliasse for you. Come at once.”</p>

<p>He had just said the same thing to Dutrex. We
hastened upstairs behind him, and followed him into
a windowless storeroom, the only entrance to which
was from the crypt beneath the great paved passage.
Here, in the darkness, I groped for the heap of straw,
and finding it, I unfastened a truss and began to
stuff the sack of ticking. The material felt strong
and hard as leather. I pricked my fingers with the
thistles in the straw. “Whatever you do, stuff the
corners well,” said my co-minister, thoroughly enjoying
his good luck. He stuffed with the dexterity of
a man who had never had anything else to do all his
life. The quartermaster, evidently coming to the conclusion
after a moment that I was a very awkward
hand, shoved me to one side, cursing in his Franconian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
patois in a way intended to show me that
he was furiously angry. Then to see him at the
stuffing! I have been told that his trade is that of
mason. He worked even faster than Dutrex. At
length, “<i>Das ist fertig</i>”—“There you are!” he cried,
giving a vigorous smack to the belly of my sack. Then,
unceremoniously, he pushed his gift on to my shoulder,
this great sack, tight and paunchy as heart could wish.</p>

<p>The acquisition of the palliasse is a revolution in
my life. I was sufficiently delighted, on entering the
storeroom, at the thought that I had said farewell to
my wretched bedding. A restless sleeper, I always
awaken with my back on the floor, stiff and aching,
burrowing in the black chaff, having scratched up my
dust like a fowl. I was uneasy at the approach of
winter. How should I be able to endure the Swabian
frosts upon this moving mattress? I should mention
that it was obviously diminishing in size, and that in
proportion as the few intact straws disappeared from
the heap, the bedding of one of my good companions
in the casemate seemed to undergo a
commensurate increase. Quite exceptional virtue
would have been required to enable him to resist
the temptation. I was occupied all day at my table
in No. 22, so that my little piece of property was
left utterly defenceless.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, in the busy obscurity of the storeroom
my joy resembled that which we take in
forbidden fruit. Though lively, it was not wholly
unalloyed. It is impossible to accept a great favour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
even if the acceptance does not involve any injury
to another, without a certain perturbation in one’s
sense of equality. My energy at the work was
diminished by a shadow of remorse.</p>

<p>But Dutrex, gay as a blackbird, stuffing his palliasse
with the fury of an assault, said to me: “Old
chap, we are to sleep in No. 22 from to-night
onwards!” This suited me very well. I should
never have been bold enough to plant my palliasse,
all new and tight as it was, among the humble
litters in the casemate. As soon as I accepted the
Teuton’s offer (and what could I do but accept it?),
my precarious tenure in No. 17 was broken. In any
case, I had become almost a stranger there. Since
my installation at the ministerial table, except for a
daily visit to my friends Guido, Bertrand, and Boude,
I never crossed the threshold until bedtime.</p>

<p>All the same, my palliasse and my change of
lodging induced feelings of sorrow as well as joy. I
might say to myself as often as I pleased that the
quartermaster, a surly Franconian who detests the
French, had done me this kindness solely through
inspiration from above (his only superior here is the
commandant); that a refusal in such conditions
would have been mere rudeness; that one need not
be so fastidious as to decline an offer involving the
enjoyment of a sleeping apartment with but one
companion, and involving also, during the winter
nights, the company of the still warm stoves; that,
for the rest, it was the act of wisdom to terminate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
at the first opportunity, and when it could be done
without shock or violence, certain chance associations
devoid of all charm. Reasons for accepting the
palliasse and the accompanying train of benefits
surged abundantly in my mind without setting my
conscience at rest.</p>

<p>Not in vain does a man drink in the gospel with
his mother’s milk; not in vain does he from childhood
onwards have instilled into him by accomplished
parents the dogmas of the republic. Be it
worth what it may, the motto of France is to me an
article of faith. I fail to act up to my principles
in this respect, but the failure makes me unhappy.
Inequality, especially inequality that redounds to my
own advantage, does injury to some profound fibre of
my being. The enjoyment of material comfort produces
periodical fits of remorse. The logic of my
heart would have me a Franciscan. Yet God knows
that my whole being and all my senses clamour for
joy and loathe the ugliness of poverty!</p>

<p>But I keep my palliasse. The bulk of my effects
had already been removed to the kitchen in No. 22.
Maître Lambert, usher at the law-court of N., for
whom I have secured employment in the kitchen as
one of the assistant cooks, went to fetch for me what
remained at No. 17. He found that my flask had
disappeared. He forgot my nightcap, which Guido
has just brought me. Now, therefore, I have everything
here—all my baggage, personal property and
national property, republican goods and royal goods.</p>

<h2 id="THE_REVOLT_OF_THE_HUNGRY">THE REVOLT OF THE HUNGRY</h2>

<p class="right"><i>October 21, 1914.</i></p>

<p>Yesterday was a great day! Perhaps the greatest
of my imprisonment, if I except that of my first
“teube.”<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Oh, that first teube! After I had worn my
clothes continuously for so many days and nights,
the clandestine undressing at early dawn, beside the
sink in Dutrex’s kitchen; the forbidden and unhoped-for
sensation, to be, as if at home, naked beneath the
steaming water; the lather of soap everywhere, on
the hair, the neck, the chest, the arms, the legs, the
feet; the douche with the aid of a bailer; the dry
rub! At length to have a clean skin and clean
linen! Then to stride up to the slopes in the delightful
morning solitude, repeating as it were involuntarily:
“I am clean; what a luxury! I am in their hands;
but I have managed to get clean. They ration our
water, and I have had water. I am a prisoner; but I
have secretly divested myself of my coating of filth, a
burden almost as heavy as that of hunger! I am by no
means wholly wretched!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a month since my last bath, at Tonnoy, about
a week before we were taken prisoner. We had had a
long and rough journey, from Chaouilley, at the foot of
the hill celebrated by Barrès, to the Moselle. The dirt
of three interminable nights in a cattle truck, in which
we were herded pell-mell; the dust of the complicated
movement towards the front; the stiffness of the opening
march, the sweat and the fatigue—I had got rid of
it all in the river. It was a beautiful evening, bright
and warm. The sun was setting. The Moselle flowed
rapidly among the islets of shingle and the sandbanks.
Groups of men, officers and soldiers, men newly called
up and reservists, indiscriminately mingled, naked as
worms, the fat, the tall, and the short, the pot-bellied
and the thin, fringed the bank with a strip of flesh-coloured
humanity. We looked like a colony of
Mormons.</p>

<p>After leaving the water, I challenged Soulier at
ducks and drakes. Do you recall, little Darry, how
we played ducks and drakes on the shore at Dully?
I got the better of Soulier. One of my flat stones,
skimming the water briskly, flying across the brown
river, made its way right over the stream to strike the
rocks on the other side.</p>

<p>When I think the matter over, this delightful bathe
remains my most agreeable souvenir of Lorraine. I
grieve to have to admit (notwithstanding Barrès, whose
style would ennoble the most worthless materials) that
all the villages we passed through, from Mont Sion to
the frontier, and above all the village of Tonnoy, left on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
me an impression of penurious and squalid melancholy,
of ugliness and filth.</p>

<p>Yes, yesterday evening was epic.</p>

<p>The morning had passed as usual: an early walk;
then work until dinner-time. There was nothing to
foreshadow a storm. I had been for a stroll after dinner
with Dutrex, Durupt, and Foch. A typical Bavarian
day: a moist sky softening the harsh outlines of the
landscape; a half light, uncertain and dreamy, as if
longing for the rich azure of Piedmont and Provence;
a piercing little wind which, even in the sunshine, continues
to suggest melting snow and cold, almost a bise,
whose very caresses sting.</p>

<p>For the last few days I had been working hard. My
faculties were blunted. I had a vague inclination to
idle. I was suffering a little from boredom, a state of
mind by which, happily, I am rarely afflicted. I was
discouraged. I wanted a rest, and yet lacked energy to
make up my mind to lay aside my work.</p>

<p>As I was returning to my task, I encountered little
Brissot. Lately he has taken to wearing the Bavarian
cap, a sort of Phrygian cap which I have made the
fashion at Fort Orff. Mine is green—you know whose
colour green is. Brissot’s is blue, and this tint sets off
admirably his energetic blond countenance. Seeing
that I was a little out of sorts, and not so cheerful as
usual, he prevented me from going down.</p>

<p>“Abandon your kitchen for a while,” he said. “It
reeks of sulphur, drains, burned fat, and vegetable
refuse. You are getting mildewed amid the steam. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
fires draw badly, and when I pay you a visit there your
eyes are watering from the smoke. Besides, you have
slaved quite enough this week under cover of your
famous notice. You can be quite easy in your mind,
you will have more than enough time to finish your
studies. The Russian generals will secure you months
and months for reflection. If that does not suffice, our
diplomatists will see to it that you have an extension of
time. This evening you must put aside your philosophies
and your histories. We will go the round of
the slopes together. The weather is fine. We will have
a talk with my little friend across the ditch; you can’t
think how sorry she is for us. Here is one, at any rate,
who is utterly unconcerned as to questions of state.
What does she care about French, Germans, English,
Belgians, Russians? She knows men only. Her heart
has skipped several centuries, and without an effort has
attained the era of thoroughgoing internationalism. I
can assure you that if she had to choose between a
<i>hübscher Franzose</i> and a <i>böser Deutscher</i>,<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> there would
be no hesitation.”</p>

<p>Brissot is light-hearted, firm, bold, definite, gently
peremptory, perfectly self-reliant; he is a surprising
compound of boy and of leader, of artist and tradesman,
endowed with a lively will; how can any one who is in
the dumps resist Brissot? I accompany him to the
parapet. Positively she is there, a sort of Munich
Flora, short and plump, with great black eyes, whom he
calls his “bonne amie,” walking upon the footpath of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
glacis, accompanied by three bare-headed village girls
and a troop of children. “Damn the escort!” says
my <i>hübscher Franzose</i> in an aside. The conversation is
opened; it is as innocent as the arched forehead and
rounded cheeks of the three slatterns. One of them is
in high spirits to know that her affianced is safe. He
has been made prisoner, and she has just received her
first letter, dated from Gap. She asks if I am betrothed,
if the ring I wear (Véron, the corporal in the engineers,
cast it for me a few days back out of one of the metal
buttons of the coat of a chausseur à pied) is an engagement
ring, and why it is made of silver. Brissot takes
the initiative in the reply, saying with an air of disgust
that it is not silver but platinum, a metal far more costly
than gold. She is astonished. She has never heard of
platinum.</p>

<p>The conversation continues, agreeably stupid. Then
the children ask for French pfennigs. “You shall have
some if you will give us a newspaper in exchange.”
The answer is not new to them; of course they have
one ready. They roll it round a stone and throw it
across the great ditch. The paper is four days old,
but we throw back some sous which fall behind them
some way down the glacis. Children and slatterns
rush greedily to pick them up. Brissot, profiting by
this moment of freedom, says to his Flora of the great
eyes: “Come again to-morrow, and without your companions,
who are not worthy of you!”</p>

<p>“My dear fellow,” I say to him, “I leave you to your
love affairs. Farewell.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>The splendid reds of autumn flame on the great oaks
along the border of the pine-wood—a strategic wood,
designed to mask the west battery. The parapets
are packed with soldiers, fine blue-and-red spots upon
a dull yellowish-green ground. Some, chisel in hand,
silently bent over their work, are carving pebbles.
Others are wearing out their finger-nails and wearing
down the corner stones in polishing tablets of white
chalk destined for employment as ex votos. The
cries of men playing at ball and at prisoner’s
base resound from the ramparts. At the foot of a
slope adorned with a clump of birches, men are
busily engaged in cooking their extra provender.
There is a circle round each improvized kitchen:
some dry and break up the small branches rifled from
the trees of the fort; some tend the refractory fire, for
the wood will not flame; some agitate the contents of
the mess-tins—fragments of stolen meat, choice morsels
of vegetable peelings, coffee dregs begged from the
kitchen, potatoes pocketed when the dinner was being
prepared, edible snails found on the grass on rainy
mornings and kept fasting in an old cigar-box, cheese-rind,
plum mushrooms, wild chicory. Soldier-priests
walk up and down reading their breviaries. On one
of the slopes, a crowd surrounds Le Second, who is
displaying his latest cubist composition; at the “kitchen
windows” a number of poor devils whose stomachs are
empty are patiently sniffing the thin odours that rise
from the cooking-pots. Here and there are to be seen
the dealers, their wares hidden beneath their coats,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
passing from group to group, and offering for sale at
three or four times its value a cigarette, a lump of
sugar, or a stick of chocolate. The blue-and-red ants
have all emerged from the subterranean galleries
of their ant-hill. On this October afternoon they
produce a sad impression of mingled gaiety and
wretchedness.</p>

<p>Yet amid this chaos I seem also to have before my
eyes the picture of a city, a city of very ancient days.
Characteristics of civic order are plainly manifest. A
semblance of social life declares itself. Broken to
pieces a few months ago by the sudden call to arms,
flattened out and pulverized by the forces of hunger
and tedium, the world that existed before the mobilization
begins to reconstitute itself. By a sort of spontaneous
generation, the eternal society rises anew from
the void, with its groups of leaders and of poets, of
traders and of artisans, with its classes of profiteers and
of exploited, of originators and of simple executants.
It is reborn, but in a less intricate form, with plainer
contrasts, accentuated to caricature. Here, temperament,
initiative, and energy have replaced tradition.
There are no privileged positions. Social functions
are not acquired as a right, but are seized. There
is free competition. We all start from scratch. Each
man takes his place in the natural hierarchy by the
sole right of conquest. He can retain it only by
cunning, force, or the power of genius, and at the
price of a persistent victory.</p>

<p>Hence there have been strange changes of fortune.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
A man who arrived without a farthing, sold for sixpence
a cigar he had been given, bought chocolate
with the sixpence, resold it at 1,000 per cent., and,
continually bargaining, always turning over his money
with increased profit, has succeeded in this way in
amassing a capital. I have several times come across
this brilliant trader on the slopes at nightfall, when he
believed himself alone. Leaning forward on his hands,
he was contemplating his greasy handkerchief stretched
out on the grass, covered with little piles of silver.
Another, who was scullion in a drinking-booth, has
taken to writing poems; at the Saturday concerts in
No. 7 he sings them to well-known airs, amid universal
applause. A man named Tarbouriech, a farmer from
the Agen district, has made himself graving tools and
carves pebbles for French and Bavarian customers. He
gets a mark for each carving, and can thus from time
to time buy himself a supplementary loaf. He is a
real decorative artist, a good sculptor, and he did not
know it.</p>

<p>As I lounge in the last rays of sunshine, I admire
the spontaneous manifestation of creative energy. I
am astonished at the superabundance of talents in so
restricted a group. Yet there is a sadness in the sight
of this poor primitive city which has set itself to sprout
upon the levelled bed of servile equality.</p>

<p>Everything betrays the stimulus of hunger. Hunger
is here the universal mother of artistic, commercial, and
industrial inventions; it even induces devotion to the
collectivity, for the performance of a public service<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
commonly secures an extra ration. Work or starve,
such is the rule. Each one makes his plans, exercises
his ingenuity, does the best for himself. The aim is
simple: not to die of hunger, to keep oneself going,
if possible to improve in appearance and to grow fat.
Some, too, having filled their stomachs, try to line their
pockets. The strong try to get the better of the weak;
the cunning, of the stupid; those who know a little
German, of those who know none at all. Hence arises
extreme inequality, tangible, crying inequality, shown
by the cheeks, the eyes, the gait—the inequality between
those who are hungry and those who are fed.
Here is one running upstairs, happy, and lively as a
cricket, for he has eaten his fill. Unashamedly he overtakes
and passes a poor devil, a man quite well off in
civil life, but who has had a visit from the body stripper
when lying in a swoon on the field of battle; he
makes his way up with great difficulty, breathless,
shaky, clinging to the banister, finding the flight of
stairs interminable.</p>

<p>Sad thoughts assail me as I walk. This battle without
rifles or artillery, exempt from immediate risk of
death, baser than war because it is more hypocritical,
more crafty, and carried on under the Christian ægis—is
it not life itself? Is not life immoral in its very
essence?</p>

<p>For, after all, one must live. First of all, one must
live. Now, here it is clear that there is not enough food
to go round. What then? Then the field is open for
the craftiest and the boldest. Let us suppose that there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
are twenty bold men among the thousand prisoners.
From the lean corpse of our cow they have cut their
large share, the lion’s share; now it is the turn of the
little jackals to divide up what remains. Let us suppose
that one of these “lions” has a conscience. Let us
suppose that his mind is influenced by the morality
of the gospels or by socialist ideas. Is he to sacrifice
his average share, the share requisite to keep him in
good health, because the others, nine hundred and
eighty in the thousand, have nothing but a famine
ration, and can have nothing else, whatever he may
do? Ought he to make up his mind, as an act of
goodwill, and knowing that the general regimen will
be no whit bettered, to accept malnutrition for himself,
to accept the permanent ruin of his health?
Christ, where are your beatitudes? Will the determinism
of the body ever be overcome? Will your
reign, your city of justice, ever be established upon
this dreary planet? But if the world continues, and if
the general supply of goods should happen to become as
greatly restricted as it is within the limits of our fortress,
I shall be sorry for the city of the just. Let the twenty
“lions,” from virtuous motives, tie up their jaws, let us
suppose that there are one thousand ascetics in place
of nine hundred and eighty, the stew will be little
thicker.</p>

<p>The electric bell, its jarring note issuing from all the
doorways, breaks in upon these grey reflections, as
much the outcome, perhaps, of personal discouragement
as of the realities of the situation. It is five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
o’clock. In a twinkling the ants disappear into the
under ways.</p>

<p class="tb">In kitchen No. 22, Dutrex, Durupt, and the three cooks
are standing round the vice. Half a gruyère cheese is
fixed in it. This is the entire dinner; each one of our four
hundred and eighty men, those fed from the first of the
three kitchens, will have to be satisfied this evening
with the four hundred and eightieth part of this half
cheese. Devèse is usually responsible for the serious
task of cutting up the cheese. He is an expert, being
accustomed every day in Paris to serve out large
quantities of ham, saveloy, and galantine. Unfortunately
our cook-butcher is confined to bed in the hospital
casemate with a sore throat. Dutrex has therefore
asked little Lambert, Maître Lambert, Lambert the
Good, to do the cutting up.</p>

<p>The great kitchen knife passes busily through the
hard, white curd. The usher of Saint-Joseph-de-Tinée
holds the knife in both hands and presses on it with all
his weight. Beads of perspiration are standing on his
besmirched forehead; his goggle eyes dilate; the ruddy
skin of his face, downy with sparse golden hairs, is
deeply wrinkled. He sweats as only a thoroughly good
fellow, a man who puts all his will into his work, can
sweat. Bouquet and Pailloux look on indifferently.
Durupt, who becomes absorbed in the most trifling
matters as if they were affairs of state, gravely counts
the slices and arranges them on the right-hand corner
of the kitchen table in piles of ten. Dutrex has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
assumed his service manner. He stands stiffly upright
at the left corner; his moustache is brushed away
from his lips, his eye is severe, he holds his check-list.
“Lambert, cut more equal slices!”</p>

<p>“Corporal Dutrex, I am doing my best, as you see;
it is very difficult.”</p>

<p>“I know it. Durupt, you will give an extra piece to
the rooms whose share is obviously too small.”</p>

<p>Seated at my table, I contemplate this Rembrandtesque
scene. The melancholy lamp, its chimney broken, is
smoking among the pale faces and the piled up slices.
The cheese is being contaminated by the foul air of
the dark casemate, in which all the stoves have gone
out. The light of the dying day still pierces the
window bars, its tender blues and reds fading slowly
away. Through the closed door comes the impatient,
angry, and menacing sound of shuffling feet. The
men waiting there know that it is “cheese evening.”
They detest this meal. It is cold and hard to digest,
less filling than a ladleful of hot semolina or vermicelli,
and makes extravagant demands upon their bread.</p>

<p>The distribution does not take long. When there
is soup and meat, our four hundred and eighty men
come individually to receive their rations, passing in
a continuous stream, first in front of the cauldron to
get the soup, and then in front of the vice for the
portion of meat. The procession lasts an hour, as at
a great funeral. “The holy water!” say the jokers,
stretching out their basins. “The handful of earth!”
extending their hands for the three ounces of cow-flesh.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
But on cheese nights there is no procession. The
twenty-three headmen of the rooms supplied from
No. 22 bring bowls, and when these are charged the
headmen go off to distribute the contents in their
respective casemates.</p>

<p>At six everything is finished. Heaving a sigh of
relief, the cooks clear the table and draw up the two
benches and the three stools. All of them, cooks and
ministers, are about to swallow their allotted rations.
These look very small, especially to Lambert, who
has been sweating blood and water.</p>

<p>There is a knock at the door. “Confound it!” says
Dutrex; “some more fellows to bother us! We never
have a moment’s peace.” Then, “Who is there?” he
shouts in a forbidding tone. Two ingratiating voices
make answer, those of little Corporal Véron and of
Boisdin, a sergeant of engineers, long as a lamp-post.
“It’s us!” Dutrex opens the door, and the two non-commissioned
officers of room No. 3 display their bowl,
wherein are heaped, not neat slices à la Devèse, but
fragments of every possible shape, square and rectangular,
thin and thick, with no rind or all rind, tapering,
pyramidal, and concave.</p>

<p>“Dutrex, old fellow,” says Véron, “we’re sorry to
bother you, but our men are on strike. They’re not
having any of these leavings. Now, just look at this
piece.” He points out a well cut slice. “This is what
the ‘poilus’ are receiving from kitchen No. 53.”</p>

<p>“My good chap,” Dutrex answers quietly, “what do
you expect me to do? I give what is given me. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
know that Sarrazin’s kitchen is specially favoured—it is
the kitchen of the Germans. For the hundred and
fifty-two men it has to supply, which includes himself
and the twenty-four Bavarians of the guard, the quartermaster
delivers almost as much as for us who are four
hundred and eighty. Go and make your complaint to
him. He’ll give you a reception. You will find out
how amiable he is. For my part, I have given up
trying to argue with this tête de Boche, who is as
obstinate as a hundred Spanish mules rolled into
one, and who detests the French. It is true that
the contents of your dish do not look very grand.
As you see, I have had to get on without Devèse.
His substitute is quite a novice. Besides, your
room was the last served, and naturally you got the
remnants. But I assure you that your full allowance is
there. Durupt allotted each ration in little heaps with
his usual conscientiousness. If your men don’t like it,
well, let’s settle the matter among ourselves. You’d
better go and consult our own medical officers. I can
do no more.”</p>

<p>Five minutes later the door opens. “Attention!”
It is the surgeon-in-chief, Monsieur Langlois, the major
with four stripes, who came here yesterday from
fort No. 8 with three colleagues, so that, with our two
other medical officers, MM. Cavaillé and Lœbre, we
have now six doctors. He is short and fat; his hair
is pepper and salt, with more salt than pepper; his
gestures are lively; his head resembles that of Poincaré;
his eyes sparkle mischievously. He takes from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
hands of Véron the allowance of No. 3. “You are
nineteen?” he asks. He quietly repeats the work of
Durupt. Upon the table, encumbered with our hunks
of bread and our rations of gruyère, he arranges the
bowlful of “leavings” in nineteen small heaps, being
careful to make them as equal as possible. He then
says: “Do you know that your room No. 3 is specially
favoured? I have seen what has been allotted to the
other rooms. I assure you, sergeant, that yours is one
of the best served. Call your men.” The men of
No. 3 are waiting outside, and, judging from the noise
which comes through the door, it would seem that there
are others in the corridor besides the men of No. 3.</p>

<p>“Men of No. 3, enter,” orders Dutrex. The nineteen
defile in front of the table and M. Langlois points
out to each man his own little heap. When they have
withdrawn, Dutrex, in the presence of Boisdin and
Véron, tells the surgeon-in-chief about Devèse’s illness
and the misdeeds of the quartermaster; how he favours
kitchen No. 53 because it is the kitchen of the Germans;
and how he takes a large “squeeze” from the supplies.
“M. le Major, I was in the guardroom yesterday. By
chance I came across his store-book, and I found that
he had entered thirty kilogrammes of rice when he had
certainly not distributed more than twelve kilos at the
outside. It is just the same with coffee, sugar, milk,
and meat. I am absolutely certain that he is a
cheat!”</p>

<p>M. Langlois listens. He listens attentively. He has
no wish to assert himself prematurely. He is not here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
to play the officer. He is a friend, an elder brother,
frank and simple. He looks behind words, and
endeavours to grasp the secret essence of the soldier
who is speaking to him. He must be a man of
intelligence, good and just.</p>

<p>“We will discuss the matter again,” he says as he
leaves. “Meanwhile, keep a record of the quantities
delivered to you. If you can manage it, make a steelyard.
For my part, I will sound the commandant. I
believe him to be well disposed. Perhaps he will be
willing to listen to a courteously worded complaint
against his quartermaster. But if we make a complaint
we must be extremely careful that we have
strong evidence to back it up. And when all is said
and done, I am under no illusions as to my power with
the German authorities. We are at war. All the conventions
have been violated. Notwithstanding the
armlet I wear, I am a prisoner just like the rest
of you.”</p>

<p>The kitchen staff sits down a second time. Every
one is enchanted with the surgeon-in-chief.</p>

<p>In the passages there is an unusual movement.
Ordinarily, when supper is over, most of the men lie
down upon their straw. The roll-call finds them nearly
all asleep. During these two hours there is no life in
the fort, except in the kitchens and in the consulting
room, which are, after a fashion, clubs where the few
intellectuals assemble to enjoy their tobacco in company,
to read the paper, or to drink the beer which
the most diplomatic among the circle has secured at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
a high price from the guardroom—all these actions
being utterly contrary to regulations.</p>

<p>It sometimes happens, however, that in their casemates
the Bretons of the 19th and the 118th of the line,
suffering from home-sickness, are day-dreaming as they
lie motionless on their couches. If, now, one of them
begins to hum softly to himself, his comrades, silent
men for the most part, will little by little take up the
strain. Most of them have clear, tender, somewhat
bleating voices. They drag at the end of the verses.
The movement is heavy and lachrymose. It sounds
like the desolate psalmody of a religion of despair
unillumined by a single gleam of hope. Or again, in
rooms No. 16 and No. 17, two fragments translated
from Provence, one hears on certain evenings, voiced
with a glad pulsation, <i>Magali</i>, <i>Galanto Chatouno</i>, and
other love-songs of old Languedoc, that country of
leisure and passion. The round coming to call the roll
stops sometimes outside the door to listen for a moment
to these graceful melodies, so different from the German
<i>Choral</i> and the German <i>Lied</i>. But the thick crypts
and walls muffle these concerts. The fort is not disturbed
by them. Even the nearest casemate will only
become aware at intervals, and remotely, of the sound
of melody. The long corridors, to which the sun never
penetrates, are already as quiet, as mournfully quiet, as
they are during the heaviest hours before the dawn.</p>

<p class="tb">The unusual activity in the passages astonishes the
cooks. The conversation outside becomes livelier, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
rises to the intensity of a real tumult. It draws nearer.
It is at the door of No. 22. Now come blows on
the door, shouts and execrations. “Resign, resign!
Fritters! Legs of mutton!” Some of the rioters
positively bellow with indignation. The blows on the
door become more violent. “Come out, if you dare!”</p>

<p>This goes on for quite two minutes. The slender
repast is finished. It is time to fetch some coal.
Pailloux and Bouquet, the head cook, take up the
coal-box, open the door, and say firmly: “Make way
for us, by thunder!” They pass out. But through the
door, which is left ajar, fists are shaken, and vociferations
rain in. “Food snatchers!” Durupt, shrugging
his shoulders, shuts the door in the shouters’ faces.
The demonstration becomes still more lively. The
noise must be heard a long way off, for suddenly there
comes a terrible growling, raucous and determined:
“<i>Zurück mit dem Pöbel!</i>”<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> In an instant the crowd,
numbering about fifty, disperses like a flight of sparrows.
A single man, Georg, the commandant’s boot-polisher,
has broken the back of the riot. He disappears. The
corridors relapse into silence, the mournful silence of
a cellar.…</p>

<p class="tb">We are invited to No. 41, to visit Juramy and Roy,
chasseurs alpins, together with Foch, d’Arnoult, and
Brissot. We go out. A man of the guard, with fixed
bayonet, slowly walks by the kitchen. He smiles and
greets us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>“<i>Grüss Gott!</i>”</p>

<p>“<i>Gute Nacht!</i>”</p>

<p>On the staircases and in the upper corridors the
“ministers” encounter glances of anger and surprise.
At No. 41 the comrades, seated upon the twin straw
piles of Roy and Juramy, receive them with marked
friendliness.</p>

<p>“Well!” says Sergeant Foch, the sturdiest soldier in
the fort, chief of the second kitchen, “so it’s your turn
this time. You have had your revolt! It seems to
have been better organized than mine. But it means
nothing. We business men, Brissot and I, know all
about the caprices of the crowd. Suddenly, without
knowing why, it rages against friends or against foes,
haphazard. These good fellows are governed by pure
instinct. In my opinion this particular revolt has been
mainly the work of the exploiters whose usurious traffic
was relentlessly suppressed by Dutrex and Durupt.
It’s bad policy to be savage with the strong and gentle
with the weak, for the strong avenge themselves. Now
they are posing as defenders of the collective stomach.
If you only knew all that they are saying, and all that
they are leading others to say! I’ve had my eye on
them for a long time. This evening they really believed
they were going to do something—that to-morrow
they would usurp your places. They were
already licking their chops. It was a case of trust
against trust. I shall laugh if the trust of virtue
proves, for once in a way, victorious.”</p>

<p>Dutrex is taciturn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>“Before the roll is called,” he says, “I shall hand in
my resignation to M. Langlois.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” says Brissot approvingly. “Otherwise
you will seem to be clinging to a fat position.”</p>

<p>“What are you thinking about?” protests Durupt.
“You will seem to justify the enemy; you will accept
defeat. The sharp practitioners who, under pretext
of serving their comrades, were buying for sixpence
from the guard commodities worth about twopence, and
selling them at a profit of a shilling, thus realizing
as much as a pound a day—these fellows whom you
saw through, who would have liked to blarney you,
but whom you summoned to the table, whom you shook
as one shakes a plum-tree, whom you threatened with
the cells (some of them even non-commissioned officers),
whom you treated in that cutting way which you know
how to assume—these sneak-thieves, who are almost
as repulsive as the body strippers, do you want with
your own hand to put them in your place in the
kitchen? I don’t understand you. I stand firm. If
there be a trust of virtue, I promise you it shall checkmate
the trust of the lick-cheeses.”</p>

<p>“Meanwhile,” says Foch light-heartedly, “let us
drink. Here’s a big jug of beer which I brought from
the guardroom under my coat. For your sake I made
myself look like a woman in the family way! What,
old Riou, are you still in the dumps? Haven’t you
got a thirst this evening?”</p>

<p>“My dear Foch, I admit that I do not feel myself
to be designed for the government of men. One who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
wishes to rule men must make up his mind to despise
them and to come to terms with their rascality. Now
(you will laugh), I respect them. I am even rather
fond of them. And it is my weakness to wish them
to be fond of me. These hostile cries, these angry
glances, which we have just had to endure—I find
them difficult of digestion.”</p>

<p>“Digest them as quickly as you can, you big baby!
It’s a stage in your education. You need to lose a
few illusions. Men are rather a poor lot. You Christians
believe that men are brothers. That’s nothing
but religious tosh. Men are no good. Brothers?—not
a bit of it. They are venomously jealous of any
one who has a straighter nose or a prettier wife than
their own, of any one with greater talent or more
charm. No doubt the worst of them have their good
days. When the weather is fine, when their bellies are
well lined, when they have done a good stroke of business,
they are pleased with every one. They are all
smiles. But what does that amount to? A momentary
intoxication. The instant they fancy that their neighbour’s
belly is fuller than their own, or that he has had
better luck in business, there is very little smile about
them, and don’t you forget it. It is true that some men
are the salt of the earth. These are worth loving, for
they are scarce. But most people pass their whole
lives in being envious. When it’s their turn to
become stiffs, it’s envy that finishes them off!</p>

<p>“If they had any sense, these fellows, I shouldn’t
mind so much. But they swallow all the gossip that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
comes their way. Morning after morning a flight of
canards settles upon the fort, and the prisoners spend
the rest of the day in roasting them. Do you know
what they are all telling one another in the casemates?
They declare that the major with four stripes made a
raid upon kitchen No. 22, and that he found fifty chops,
seventy steaks, a leg of mutton, a lot of fritters, a store
of cheese—all pinched by Durupt from the men’s
rations. Whereupon the major sent you to the cells
under guard of four bayonets! Now you know why
these rascals looked at you with angry surprise as you
passed along the passage.</p>

<p>“When such fellows are really famished, as they are
here, seeing that they are jealous and stupid, and,
above all, driven out of their senses by starvation, how
can you expect them to be anything but idiots? All
at once, they see red, and must instantly have a victim.
But they are incapable of finding one for themselves.
Always some cunning rogues among them point out
the victims, indicating as if by chance the men of
whom they are jealous, and whom they long to
replace. Don’t take it so much to heart. In ten years
from now it will all seem to you perfectly natural.”</p>

<p>This profession of social faith gives me no pleasure,
although to-night the temptation to approve it is only
too strong. What an affair! It is precisely the kitchen
run by Dutrex and Durupt, men of principle, men who
may be said to be scrupulous to excess, before which
a noisy demonstration is made, whilst no one attempts
to interfere with kitchen No. 53, notoriously privileged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
by the quartermaster. How mean! And it is Frenchmen,
men of intelligence, men quite capable of recognizing
the real causes of things, who, inspired by envy
and revenge, have directed against No. 22 the vague
wrath of hungry stomachs! <i>Fames malesuada.</i> Yes,
this is what it means, the ambition of a few turning
to profit the hunger of all.</p>

<p>It is strange, but a clear recognition of the motives
that have brought about this storm in a teacup
produces in my mind a sort of philosophic disillusionment.
My thoughts pass quite beyond the
present affair. I find myself dreading all at once
lest the great social movements, those I most admire,
those I see on the horizon of history, sublime,
heroic, superhuman like the Marseillaise of the Arc
de Triomphe, may not resemble this trifling affair,
which aimed, beneath the standard of justice, at
introducing a set of rogues into the heart of the
temple of their thoughts, the kitchen.</p>

<p>If we look at matters without prejudice, a little
thing is just as significant as are many events which
are regarded as grand simply because the trumpeters
of a faction or of a nation have magnified their
importance. Indeed, this attempted revolution concerning
a piece of cheese suddenly renders all
revolutions suspect to me. The little revolution
seems to spoil the great revolution, and to lessen
the stature of humanity. Is it possible that, in the
last analysis, clamours for justice are nothing more
than the growls of envy?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>Dutrex left us early. I stayed in No. 41 until the
roll-call. I was genuinely unhappy.</p>

<p>It need hardly be said that M. Langlois absolutely
refused to accept any resignations.</p>

<p class="tb">To-day I was out walking before dawn. My
thoughts were gloomy. The sun rose in a calm sky,
a sky that was greenish-blue, clear, and magnificent,
with a flotilla of tiny clouds, white tipped with gold,
and melting away at the edges.</p>

<p>When I began work just now I was well content,
content to be here, among the placidly gurgling
cauldrons, and away from the company of men. But
this sudden access of misanthropy is probably the
sequel of my fit of the blues. I am “fortorffish,”
as the prisoners say. The paroxysm will soon pass.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="A_CHANCE_CATERER">A CHANCE CATERER</h2>

<p class="right"><i>November 6, 1914.</i></p>

<p>The weather is sombre. The winter is coming on
apace. On the grass, rusted by the frost, the leaves
fallen from the willows have already rotted. This
morning a gentle, damp wind was blowing, increasing
at times to vent long sighs. The whole sky was
bistre. Towards France, however, an islet of light
was visible. On the Austrian side, the dawn had the
ardent flushes of sunset. Skimming the ground, great
flights of noisy crows were settling down on the freshly
turned ploughs.</p>

<p>Things are going badly in the fort. Not that there
is any fear of defeat. Durupt has been at pains to
translate the <i>Deutschland über alles</i> of the German
military march into a sonorous <i>Alles über Deutschland</i>
filled with hope. But even Durupt, our Déroulède, is
depressed. He had promised us liberty before All
Saints’ Day and All Souls’ Day, declaring it certain
that we should celebrate these festivals at home. But
All Saints’ Day has passed without the faintest murmur
of peace. Yesterday evening the revictualling officer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
said to Foch: “The war will last two years.” This
prophecy has gone the round of the casemates,
disseminating gloom. Every one’s patience is exhausted.</p>

<p>Our dietary is still further reduced. To-day we had
some horrible little prunes, two years old and as hard as
wood, in lieu of meat. Henceforward our five companies
are to supply every day a gang of a hundred men
to work five miles from here on the military hutments.
Ten miles march, eight hours’ work, and to make up
for this fatigue duty, a sausage of about the size of
your finger. The German ganger, a tailor by trade, and
a man with the finest beard you ever saw, is by no
means a bad fellow. During fifteen years he has made
the seat of his trousers shiny in the tailors’ workrooms
of Paris. He has no hatred for the French. As he
passes from group to group with his eternal, “Allons,
messieurs, travaillons un peu, n’est-ce pas?”<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> he
modulates his voice in such alluring intonations, that
one would say he was a salesman in the rue Blanche
tempting a fair customer to inspect his wares. But
the customers of our tailor-ganger are proof against
temptation.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Brissot was with the gang as interpreter.
The work is going on as slowly as usual, twenty
men getting in one another’s way where two would
suffice, when, towards four o’clock, the chief engineer-officer,
the <i>Baurat</i>, arrives on the scene. His tone is
rough, and he makes impatient gestures. He accuses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
the men of slacking, whereupon Brissot makes answer,
in his cold and cutting manner: “<i>Herr Major</i>, what
can you expect them to do when their stomachs are
empty? They can’t work any harder. Look at them!
Their eyelids and the wings of their nostrils are blue.
Do you see that fellow in the trench? He eats every
earthworm that he turns up with his spade! At home
in France, <i>Herr Major</i>, I am an employer of labour,
and I expect my men to work hard. But I pay good
wages, and they get plenty to eat. Can I honestly
ask these poor devils, who are starving, to do any real
work?”</p>

<p>At this unexpected reply, the officer bridles as if he
had been flicked with a switch. It is too much for
him that a common soldier, a Frenchman, a prisoner,
can speak so boldly to him, the great <i>Major</i>, the master.
Thunderstruck, half in mind to strike the presumptuous
fellow, he suddenly turns on his heel, and, cursing
loudly, he flings himself into his Mercédès, spits out a
command, and drives in hot haste to Fort Orff, where
he issues orders that Brissot is never to accompany
the gang again.</p>

<p>Having got wind of this affair, I sought out the
eater of earthworms. He was a reservist of the 211th
regiment, from Montauban. He was didactic, and explained
to me that worms are no longer edible when
you dig too deeply. Those more than two feet from
the surface have a bitter taste. “They look all right;
they are large and fat; but they are nothing but
earth!” The quaint thing is that this little fellow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
sturdy, hairy, and bronzed, by no means looks starved.
It seems that the earthworm must be nutritious.</p>

<p>Nor is this the only culinary discovery inspired by
the regimen of famine. When Brissot is eating his
piece of Münster cheese on Tuesday and Saturday
evenings, a comrade stands at gaze, rubbing his hands.
At length he says: “You mustn’t squander the rind.”
Brissot hands over the rind, which he has purposely
cut rather thick. The man then adds: “But you
mustn’t squander the paper either.”—“What will you
do with this dirty, stinking piece of paper?”—“I
shall boil it with some potato peelings under the
birch-trees. It’s splendid seasoning. Don’t you see
that it is soaked with cheese-fat?” This same
prisoner, a nice lad, always good-humoured, well set
up, hunts rats in the grass. His most famous dish,
one he prepared a fortnight ago, was a stew of apple
parings with rats. He secured the apple parings from
the participants in a sort of “banquet,” a clandestine
“feast” partaken of one evening by a large
group of friends after an unusually liberal consignment
had been received through the instrumentality
of Georg.</p>

<p>It was dusk. Brissot and I were strolling along the
slopes discussing, apropos of Bergson, the relationships
between philosophy and life. I was surprised that,
instead of pushing straight ahead, he turned about.
I like to walk quickly, but he insisted upon pacing
gently to and fro on the top of the slope looking
towards Hepperg. Hands in pockets, wearing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
close-fitting tunic of the chasseurs alpins, little Brissot
was scanning the horizon from time to time, when
two men whom I had not noticed before, Loux, a
colonial infantryman, and Vernes, a linesman of the 1910
class, a compositor on <i>Le Journal</i>, who were stationed at
the two angles of the eastern escarp, simultaneously
exclaimed: “There he is!”—“Hullo!” says Brissot,
“he’s got a big load this evening.” I look. From behind
the recently felled pine-trees bordering the Hepperg
road appears a man carrying a box under one arm and
a large sack under the other. He crosses the ploughed
fields and comes straight in our direction. His progress
is slow. He stumbles over the ridges. He looks
utterly exhausted. From time to time he stops and
deposits his two burdens on the ground. After he has
reached the foot of the battery, we lose sight of him for
some minutes. Then he reappears upon the advanced
glacis, among the wild rose bushes. I recognize Georg
Doppel, the baron’s orderly, his face grey and dripping
with sweat. He is in full dress, looking very smart in
the light blue Bavarian uniform with its red cuff-facings.
He wears a fancy cap similar to that of his <i>Herr Major</i>.
But here comes the sentinel making his rounds!
“Twenty-two,” call out Vernes and Loux. Brissot
takes off his cap; it is a signal. Georg lies down
among the bushes. The sentinel, pipe in mouth, his
threadbare <i>Mütze</i> drawn down over his eyes, walks carelessly
by, looking like a country bumpkin. His rifle,
hanging to the sling, knocks against his thighs. He
passes on to the northern wall and disappears. Brissot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
puts on his cap again. “Get to the rope, quick!” says
he to Loux, “and you, Vernes, to the ditch!” Georg
has placed his sack and his box on the masonry of the
counterscarp. He ties them to a rope and allows them
to glide down into the great ditch. There Vernes receives
the goods, sets them against the wall of the escarp,
and ties them successively to the rope which the colonial
infantryman lowers to him from the top of the wall.
Two hauls, and the food is inside the fort. It is now
quite dark, and Vernes and Loux hurry off to get them
safely housed in No. 34, Brissot’s room.</p>

<p>Georg makes for the great iron gate and rings the
bell. The man on guard peeps out through the judas.
Recognizing the commandant’s orderly, he hastens to
unbolt the gate, and respectfully draws aside, though
without going quite so far as to stand to attention
as he would for the major himself. The boot-polisher
enters, firm of tread, head erect, giving a gentle greeting.
In the most dignified manner he makes his way to
No. 34. “<i>Grüss Gott, Georg!</i>” Conversation ensues
between him and Brissot. Gold coins pass from the
French purse into the German, and the boot-polisher
takes his leave. “Now then, you chaps,” says Brissot,
“let’s have dinner!”</p>

<p>To-day Brissot’s guests ate buttered eggs, herrings
from the Baltic, known here as “Bismarcks,” and a
great dish of stewed pippins, all washed down with the
contents of a small barrel of cool beer, and cooked upon
an illicit stove by Loux, the colonial infantryman, a
sabot-maker from Bresse, cook-in-ordinary to Brissot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>Since this banquet, the sprightly Le Second, who in
the kitchens had already nicknamed our “salon” the
“navel of Fort Orff,” has taken to calling casemate
No. 34 the “Capua of Fort Orff.”</p>

<p>The palliasse of the man who is averse to “squandering”
is not far from that on which Brissot and his
guests were dining, semi-recumbent in Roman fashion.
The rat-hunter was watching their culinary activities.
When the time came to dispose of the herrings, he ran
up, saying: “Don’t squander the heads and the tails!”—“There
you are, old chap.”—“That will be fine
seasoning to-morrow for my rats. These fish are
dripping with brine. Since the kitchens have been
rationed in the matter of salt I have found it impossible
to get even a pinch from the cooks.” When the diners
attacked the pippins, each guest peeling a portion for
the common stew, the little soldier said: “Don’t
squander the parings.” Nimble and lively as a squirrel,
he ran from one to another, receiving the strips of peel
in his képi as they fell from the knife.</p>

<p>I saw him next day under the birches, beaming with
delight over his stewpan. “Here’s plenty!” he said.
“I have a rat, the apple peelings, and the heads and
tails of the Bismarcks! Best of all, they have just
turned out this straw here.”—“But the straw is contaminated.
Surely you know that this is the bedding
from a lousy casemate.”—“What does that matter?
Fire purifies everything. It’s a devil of a business now
to get any wood in the fort. Reeds, raspberry canes,
the lower branches of the trees—they’ve all been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
burned. Some of our fellows are attacking the timber-shores
of the counterscarp and the lids of the latrines.
But that is a dangerous game. I don’t want to spend
a week in the clink on bread and water.”</p>

<p>With these words he began to throw the condemned
straw by handfuls between the two stones of his fireplace.
What a smoke it made! From time to time,
with his hard and black fingers he lifted the scorching
lid of the mess-tin, saying, “Just look at this rat, it’s
as large as a guinea-pig!” Licking the stick with which
he had been stirring his stew, he exclaimed: “I assure
you this will be excellent. The dash of fish gives it a
rare flavour!”—“But tell me,” I said, “what use do you
make of the Münster cheese-rind? The comrades have
told me that you collect it from them.”—“I put it in my
bowl when I go for my ration of coffee. It melts in the
hot liquid. I give a stir, and then I have coffee with
cream. It beats caramel. If Brissot knew that, I bet
you he’d keep the rind for himself!”</p>

<p>Since yesterday, Brissot has been extremely put out.
Germany is short of men, and all the physically unfit
have orders to present themselves for re-examination.
Upon receipt of his notice, Georg trembled. Providing
himself with a pair of large spectacles, he set out for
Ingolstadt. To gain the double end of having a good
time and of making himself look sickly, he went on the
spree. It was of no avail; he was declared <i>feldtauglich</i>,
fit for active service.</p>

<p>Yesterday the commandant, walking between M.
Langlois and me, observed: “My <i>Diener</i> has not come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
back yet from Ingolstadt. He is a good boy, but he
sometimes takes extraordinary ideas into his head.
The other day he asked my permission to present his
sister to me. I agreed, and gave him an afternoon’s
leave to go and fetch her. I did not see him again for
three days. When he returned, he acknowledged that
his ‘sister’ was a lady-love from Ratisbon whom he
was pining to see, and for whose journey he had paid.
This time I have sent him before the medical board,
and he has been away for two days! He is an excellent
servant, but he has odd ways.” Baron von Stengel
laughed. I made answer: “<i>Herr Major</i>, your <i>Bursch</i>
seems to me a smart man, lively and intelligent, and of
imposing appearance. I would rather be served by a
clean and ready-witted rogue than by a virtuous
dullard.”—“I am quite of your opinion, monsieur
Riou.”</p>

<p>Georg did not turn up until this morning. I was
working at the “ministerial” table. The eight
cauldrons were steaming fiercely. The kitchen was
filled with vapour, so that I could hardly see what I was
writing. Suddenly some one tapped me on the shoulder.
I turned round, to find Brissot, accompanied by Georg.
I shook them both by the hand.</p>

<p>“<i>Felduntauglich?</i>” (Ineligible?)</p>

<p>“<i>Nein! Donnerwetter!</i>”</p>

<p>“Georg wants you to do him a service,” said Brissot.
“Will you translate for him this letter to the French
medical officers?”</p>

<p>I drew a sheet of paper from my haversack. Without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
studying the contents of the petition as a whole, I
translated it phrase by phrase, almost word for word.
This is what I wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">“<span class="smcap">Honoured Comrades</span>,—</p>

<p>“In an unexpected manner, has struck the
hour which summons me to fight for my king and
country. Like all of you, I must do my duty; and,
like all of you, it is possible that in a short time I shall
find myself in France (<i>sic</i>) as a prisoner of war. If I
encounter there men having like sentiments with myself,
I shall have no fears for the future. As far as I have
been able, I have fulfilled towards you and your
comrades the duty of loving one’s neighbour.</p>

<p>“An old proverb says: ‘What you do to me, I will
do to you!’ I trust that you also, honoured comrades,
will take this proverb to heart.</p>

<p>“I am a poor soldier who was orphaned in early
childhood, and who, from the age of eight upwards, had
to live among strangers.</p>

<p>“From my sixteenth to my twenty-fourth year I
have been a wanderer in the world, and my experiences
have been mingled of good and evil.</p>

<p>“You will excuse me, honoured comrades, if I now
venture to make a request.</p>

<p>“Among your colleagues there must be some in a
position to do me a good turn.</p>

<p>“I beg the officers to allow a little collection to be
made, and shall be eternally grateful for this permission.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>“Awaiting your favours, I remain, the most devoted
of your comrades,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Georg Doppel</span>.</p>

<p>“PS.—I had some conversation yesterday with the
principal medical officer of the Ingolstadt hospital. He
informed me that there would be a continual exchange
of medical officers and of the personnel of the French
medical department with German prisoners.”</p>

</div>

<p>Without comment, I handed the letter to Brissot, who
then said: “Georg also wants you to give him a letter
of introduction to the principal medical officer.” It is
a weakness of mine that I cannot say “no,” and I
therefore promptly wrote this note:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">“<span class="smcap">Monsieur le Médecin-chef</span>,—</p>

<p>“M. Georg Doppel has begged me to translate
the accompanying petition, and to give him a letter of
introduction to you. In my humble opinion, he has
rendered services [I should have liked to add the words
‘extremely onerous’] to many of our comrades. For
my own part, I shall gladly contribute to a collection,
if you think it well to permit one.</p>

<p class="center">“Your affectionate soldier,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Gaston Riou</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p>In a very few minutes, M. Langlois arrived. “Here’s
a funny business!” he cried, laughing with his mischievous
eyes and all his fat and benevolent little body.
“This letter of Doppel’s is a pearl! I shall treasure it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
And the Parthian shaft-the postscript promising my
own release! Doppel is really a most amusing rascal.”</p>

<p>“And what are you going to do, monsieur le Médecin-chef?
Are you going to allow the collection?</p>

<p>“Certainly not. Hasn’t he fleeced us enough already?
He ought to have put something by.”</p>

<p>“No doubt. But he never thought they would send
him to the front. He imagined that he would be able
to go on luxuriating at our expense in the neighbouring
villages, living like a lord, until the end of the war.
The fact is, he is pretty well cleared out!”</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry. I’ve been able to make his mind
easy. I have just given him a general letter of introduction
to the French officers. If you had seen him
unbuttoning his tunic and putting away my letter in
the pocket of his shirt as if it had been a scapular!
To be a prisoner in France will be like heaven to him.
I am sure that I have deprived Germany of a rifle.”</p>

<p class="tb">Poor Georg! Poor Bavarian Gil Blas! You are of
those who come to terms frankly with their prejudices
and their appetites. The service of king, country, and
religion; the precepts of morality: he has never had
any thought of violating these sacred things. He
allows them to float vaguely in his heaven and to
widen the horizon of his thought, remote images which
it is obvious that people love, familiar lineaments of the
region in which he is accustomed to live. The idea has
never entered his mind to declare that the idols of his
nation are false gods. He endeavours to humbug them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
but he believes in them. He is no scoundrel. He
lacks the unalloyed selfishness, the whole-hearted
scepticism, characteristic of the thoroughgoing knave,
the successful brigand, the true diplomatist and dealer
in men. His actions are unscrupulous, not so his
thoughts.</p>

<p>Hedonist, scapegrace, having at bottom the heart of a
child, indifferently adapting his practice to his beliefs or
his beliefs to his practice, he reveres in good faith, like
most Germans, virtue, honour, religion, the prince.
With the grandiloquence natural to his race, he
embellishes in his own mind the most trifling of his
private machinations.</p>

<p>A little while ago, a French comrade asked him to
pay a debt. He frowned, drew himself up, and
assumed an offended air. Turning to d’Arnoult, who
was passing at the time, he said:</p>

<p>“When I think of the way in which, scorning the
risk of death, I have provided him with goods, how I
have hazarded my life again and again to bring him
tobacco, and that he now dares, in your presence, to
insult me by asking for this paltry sum of twenty-four
marks! I punish such a man with my contempt.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” answered d’Arnoult commiseratingly, “don’t
rub it in. You have punished him enough already!”</p>

<p>Georg has a soaring imagination. He loves the great
and the impressive, that which breathes order and
power. He loves his commanding officer. He loves
the royal army. He loves his uniform. He loves that
civilians should tremble before him. He loves to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
admired. He loves to make a heroic figure in the
world. After one of our casual feasts, when Brissot
asks him to sing some Munich songs, he reserves always
for the tit-bit certain verses which he declares he wrote
himself in praise of one of his numerous <i>Geliebten</i>. We
gather that in the village of Hepperg alone six women
are madly in love with him—the burgomaster’s wife,
the schoolmaster’s wife and sister, the wives of both the
grocers, and the belle of the countryside. “The seven
nights of the week,” he gravely assures us, “hardly
suffice.” Whereupon, this Don Juan removes his cap
and takes a small collection from the guests. He is so
expert a liar that I suspect him of being the first victim
of his own romances. Every one knows him to be
<i>felduntauglich</i>, a man unfit for active service. But this
is no hindrance to his having taken part in the battle
of Dieuze and to his having been wounded there by a
French bullet! He bares his chest and makes you
touch the scar. Tarascon is situated much further to
the north than most people imagine.</p>

<p>On All Souls’ Day we went to the Ingolstadt
cemetery. Détry and I carried the wreath. Half
hidden by the leafy garlands, tied with the French
colours, we set the pace firmly through the Theresienstrasse,
which was packed with townsmen come to stare
at us, almost all in mourning—old men, women, wounded
soldiers on leave, and a noisy rout of children. There
were no hostile cries, as there had been two months
earlier. Some of the onlookers uncovered as we passed;
the children loudly demanded buttons as souvenirs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
crying <i>Knopf</i>, <i>Knopf</i>, in a manner that was not at all
bellicose. We went at the quick march, eyes front,
knowing well that we, the prisoners, were the victors.</p>

<p>Our squad had a fine appearance. We had selected
the best-looking and tidiest of our men. Three of our
medical officers, MM. Jeandidier of Longwy, Romant of
Marseilles, and Bouvat of Ardèche, sturdy figures all,
marched at the head, immediately behind the wreath.
Eight Bavarians with fixed bayonets escorted us.
Lacking their spiked helmets, which they had been
compelled to hand over to men in the fighting-line,
still with the countryman’s slouch, for drill had not yet
had time to take effect, their stiff legs finding it difficult
to accommodate themselves to our brisk French pace,
these peasant farmers and agricultural labourers made
a poor show. This also gave us pleasure. Among
these good Swabians, our feelings were much like those
of the Athenians in Bœotia.</p>

<p>But Georg, who marches at my left as a supernumerary,
wears a helmet. Dapper, authoritative,
disdainfully chiding his compatriots, he feels that his
mere presence serves to atone for the humble and
awkward bucolicism of the escort. At the cemetery
he uncovers; he marshals us around the sixty French
graves. He follows the Latin prayers with a thoughtful
air. When, in accordance with a suggestion made by
M. Langlois, we then go to pray beside the graves of
the German soldiers, his eyes are moist. He remains
dignified.</p>

<p>When the commemoration is over, and when, the rest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
of the little troop having started back for the fort, the
three medical officers, with Durupt, Détry, and myself, go
for a walk through the town under Georg’s supervision, he
suddenly declares himself in a great hurry to return.</p>

<p>“By the commandant-major’s orders we must be at
Orff for dinner!”</p>

<p>“But it is only four o’clock!”</p>

<p>“We’ve a long way to walk.”</p>

<p>“Anyhow, by the commandant-major’s orders we have
to go to the bank, the bookseller, the tailor, and the
surgical instrument maker.”</p>

<p>“Order? It is not an order. You can hardly call it
a permission!”</p>

<p>“Never mind.”</p>

<p>So we go to the Königliche Bayerische Bank, where,
in exchange for good French gold, we receive packets
of one mark notes; to the military tailor, who, with the
assistance of a plump and smiling wife, does his best to
find for us among the German reds one that sufficiently
resembles our scarlet; to the bookseller, whose window
is beplastered with picture postcards of Zeppelins flying
over the Place de l’Opéra, of battles, of soldiers in
the death agony thinking of their fiancées (figured in
the corner of the card haloed in shining clouds); to the
surgical instrument maker, where Détry, our dentist, is
careful not to supply all his needs on this occasion,
desiring an excuse for another visit to the town.</p>

<p>The boot-polisher hustles us on. Here we are in the
street, three in front, three behind, flanked by Georg’s
bayonet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>All at once, seeing a pastrycook’s window, with a
grand display of buns and tarts beneath the lamps, with
one impulse, without stopping to parley, we hurl ourselves,
all six, into the <i>Conditorei</i>. Georg invokes all
the devils of hell, but follows us. “Mange,” says
Détry to him, forcing him to sit down at a table
loaded with custard tartlets and éclairs. And we, who
have been craving for sweet things for months, begin to
devour all that comes to our hands. Trembling with
concupiscence, I go to the counter, I take the mistress
by the hand, and, my mouth full, say to her: “Madame,
you will be an angel if you can get me two pounds of
butter!” She does not sell butter, but a mother is never
able to resist the cry of a child, and she lets me have her
own butter. “I can buy some more,” she says with a
smile. I open the show-cases: “Hullo, Suchard! How
much this pile?” She names the price. “There you
are.” Then I spy some little sponge-cakes coated with
sugar. In a trice I have filled my haversack, which I
carry beneath my coat. Big-bellied as a Bavarian, I am
unable to rebutton.</p>

<p>“<i>Vorwärts!</i>” cries Georg, stuffed with good things.
We pay our shot. Leaving the pastrycook’s we overwhelm
our gaoler with prayers: “Do let us go to the
ham and beef shop, to the tobacconist.…”—“It’s
absolutely impossible,” he cries. In reality, he dreads
losing his commission! He marches on at a terrible
rate, kicking out of the way, driving out of the way
with the butt end of his musket, the escorting rabble of
children. It is only two young girls of really charming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
appearance, ten or twelve years of age, who walked by
my side on the way to the cemetery and to whom I
said, “I have sisters of your age who are like you,” that
continue to accompany me, notwithstanding the roughness
of the <i>Bursch</i>. We talk like old friends. They
leave us at the wicket of the cavalry barracks, with a
parting “<i>Grüss Gott, Herr Franzose!</i>”</p>

<p>My companions are still arguing with Georg. “It
won’t take a minute to buy a dozen packets of tobacco
and a string of sausages!” The innocents! They
reason with Georg. Durupt especially, who is eloquent
in the Teutonic tongue, surpasses himself. “To be at
the source of all good things and not to drink from it!
To pass stupidly by!”—“<i>Ne, ne</i>,” the <i>Bursch</i> growls
continually. Now we are traversing badly lighted
streets. We make our way through the suburbs, and
beyond the station we reach the dull country on the
outskirts of the town.</p>

<p>“Old fellow,” says Détry to Durupt, “we are greatly
indebted to you. With all your German, you have not
been smart enough to get us the smallest of sausages, a
single pipefull of tobacco! It is obvious, O Durupt the
Just, that you do not know the only language in which
it is possible to persuade Georg!”</p>

<p>We are about to reach a tavern. Détry, who does
not know a word of German, lays a hand on the orderly’s
shoulder. Abstracting Georg’s hat, he puts it on his
own head and decorates the Bavarian with the French
képi. Georg beams! Then Détry shakes him vigorously
by the hand, saying: “Tiens, mon poteau! voilà<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
pour graisser ta sale patte.”<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Georg does not understand
French, but he understands very well that he has
two marks in his hand. Arm in arm, the two comrades
lead the way. In front of the inn, Détry loudly calls,
“<i>Bier, Bier!</i>” The innkeeper comes forth, wearing a
military uniform. All smiles, he invites us to enter.
We place two mugs in the hands of Georg and lay
before him a plate of steaming sausages. In this rig,
with his rifle and fixed bayonet against his shoulder, he
is irresistible. I make the tour of the <i>Wirtschaft</i> and
discover a number of plates charged with slices of cold
meats ready for a battalion which is about to pass on
its way to the Russian front. “How much, <i>gnädige
Frau</i>?”—“Fifty pfennig a plate.”</p>

<p>What a dinner we ate! It was not a varied menu,
but quantity made up for everything. The joy of it!
You who have never been hungry, you who have never
been rationed, cannot understand how it is that there is
no delight in the world greater than that of finding oneself,
after three months’ imprisonment, in front of plates
filled with sausage, salad of ox muzzle, and gherkins.
The <i>Wirt</i> had a swarm of children. We treated the
children. We overwhelmed them with pfennig. We
paid the most polite compliments to the <i>gnädige Frau
Wirtin</i>.</p>

<p>We were intoxicated, not with beer, but with the
feeling of plenty. We ordered cigars. “Have you
boxes of cigars?”—“Here you are.”—“How much?”—“And
this cluster of sausages? Can I buy them?
How much?” We made a clean sweep. Georg continued
to eat and to drink, amid a rain of friendly smiles
and pats on the back. All of us being thoroughly
replete, we resumed our journey. There was a thick
fog. Two companies of the Bavarian battalion in full
marching kit, on the way to entrain, met us. They
went by, walking heavily, without a word. We were
singing.</p>

<p>Détry made Georg repeat some French phrases:</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle, voulez-vous tanser?”</p>

<p>“Non, môssieu, <i>ch</i>’ai mal au pied.”</p>

<p>Master and pupil kicked up their legs in unison. We
held our sides with laughter. To tell the truth, this
unwonted good cheer had turned our heads a little.</p>

<p>Détry was pelting Durupt with gibes. “Old Aristides
the Just, you will never know how to manage
men. Georg is like all the Bavarians in our guard—he
thinks first of all of his own skin, and next he likes
to enjoy himself. Don’t you talk to me about German
honour and German virtue. These fellows are very
fond of sonorous phrases, but they can’t resist a modest
tip!” No doubt Détry was exaggerating a little.</p>

<p>Georg is no longer gay. Closed, alas, his Fort Orff
campaign, his campaign of junketings and sensual
enjoyments. Now he is to have a taste of real war.
Poor Georg, if only his imaginary wound of Dieuze<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
could suffice. Certainly he loves German “glory,”
German “virtue.” Certainly he loves his king. But
he loves just as much to be cock of the walk in the
villages, with the aid of French money! He loves the
fatherland and military displays. But he loves also to
feed well and to lie warm. He is fond of so many
things that he always chooses the nearest and the
easiest, and his actions are invariably dictated by
opportunity.</p>

<p>Now he is to go to the firing-line. In a few days
he will be rotting in the trenches, his boots sticking fast
in the clay. Despite the best will in the world, he may
be laid low by a bullet before he has found a favourable
opportunity of getting himself safely taken prisoner by
the French. His name will then appear in the lists
among those of the heroes who have fallen on the
field of honour. Such is life!</p>

<p>But how will my dear little Brissot manage in future
to procure chocolate and Baltic herrings?</p>

<h2 id="OUR_GAOLER">OUR GAOLER</h2>

<p class="right"><i>November 13, 1914.</i></p>

<p>On Sunday, Baron von Stengel went to the Palatinate
to buy horses for the artillery. He returned yesterday
evening, after an absence of five days, looking a little
thinner, his eyes weeping from a cold in the head.
The weather in the transrhenish province had been
wintry. The railway service was irregular, so he
was compelled to make use of an open motor.
During the first snows he had to drive about the
country visiting horse-dealers. He is seventy years
of age.</p>

<p>He has just been walking up and down with us,
and recounting to us the incidents of this unexpected
journey. “I tired myself out to no advantage,” he
said. “Horses are becoming rare with us, almost as
rare as louis d’or. You have Algeria, Boulonnais, the
region round Tarbes, and the splendid horse-breeding
centre of Huysne. We have nothing of the kind. The
question of remounts is becoming serious. It has been
difficult to buy even a few horses in the Palatinate.
Sorry screws, and dear at that! The peasants asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
from two to three thousand marks for horses worth
eight hundred at the outside.”</p>

<p class="tb">Our commandant is very tall and upright, with
a finely cut jaw, and a round flat beard like the
knights in the days of Maximilian of Austria. His
manners are above criticism. His natural dignity is
relieved by a genial expression of countenance.</p>

<p>He has the equable temper and regulated life of a sage.
Precise but never punctilious, he fulfils here the duties
of postmaster, money-changer, censor of correspondence,
headmaster, major-domo—and does it all without irritability
and without giving the impression that he is
lowering himself in any way. In his bold, firm, regular,
almost heraldic handwriting, he registers the arrival and
departure of letters; he enters in the account-book payments
we make for haberdashery; he keeps memoranda
of the interminable series of money-orders. He works
deliberately, making neat rows of figures, using a ruler
whenever he wishes to draw a line, and taking great
care not to ink his long white fingers or to make blots
on the large folios of ministerial paper. There is not a
speck of dust on his writing-table; everything is neatly
laid out in squares, as in a French garden. Behind him,
on the top of the closed wash-hand stand, a lemon, cut in
two exactly equal halves, a loaf of ration bread, cut with
precision, and a glass of fresh water, combine to form a
picture as definite and sober as a scene of still life by
Chardin. The casemate is well-lighted, vast, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
keeping with its tenant. A narrow iron bedstead, a
trunk, a clothes-hanger upon which are seen a <i>Mütze</i>, a
long grey cape, and a sword; two deal tables standing
end to end, one for himself and the other for d’Arnoult,
his secretary; a small dressing-table, three chairs—this
comprises all the furniture. In this formal, cold, geometrical
environment sits the huge man (much too large
for his table, so that his arms and legs are cramped),
writing all day.</p>

<p>Humble work, well within the capacity of any honest
“swivel-officer” of the reserve. But Baron von Stengel,
bending his long back to it, infusing it with his air of
refinement, stamps it with an almost hieratic character.
It is possible that he would prefer to be in command of
a park of artillery upon the Warthe or upon the Ypres
canal. Perhaps he envies his two sons, captains in the
army of Lorraine, who have just announced to him
almost simultaneously the receipt of the iron cross.
But this much is certain, that it is not without sadness
that he recalls the last war.</p>

<p>He thinks of the 1870 campaign, which, as <i>Oberleutnant</i>,
he spent at Ulm, employed, as to-day, in
guarding prisoners. He thinks of his young colleagues
of those days, of the interminable conversations when
they were all intoxicated with the glorious news that
streamed in, the news of Wörth, Borny, Gravelotte,
Metz, and Sedan. He recalls the ardency of those
years, and the cheerful noise of his steps as he walked
beside the Danube in the beautiful night-time. He
remembers seeing in the river the reflection of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
cathedral spire, graceful and ornate, a silent witness of the
ancient German glories then renascent—victory, love.</p>

<p>He was an old man when the new call to arms came.
Nevertheless he offered his services to King Louis;
though a septuagenarian, he begged to be allowed to
help. Hence he is at Fort Orff. To one who watches
him at work, censoring our letters, doing our little
banking business, fulfilling the thousand and one
trifling duties of his office, it is obvious that he is
performing a rite, the great rite of patriotism.</p>

<p>Although hungry men are seldom just, I have never
heard any of the prisoners utter a single ill-natured
word about the commandant. As he walks with slow
gait along the parapet, every one salutes him with
manifest goodwill. White-headed, wearing an ample
grey cloak falling in straight folds, he looks like a
patriarch of ancient days visiting his faithful tribe.
He wields authority so naturally, and is so free from
hauteur, that no one dreams of murmuring. He has
worked the miracle of uniting in a sentiment of respect
for his personality all the inhabitants of this little
France of Fort Orff, this miniature of great France, the
factious and ungovernable nation, the nation of eternal
discontent. He is so obviously straightforward and
humane that the most savage of our prisoners would
protest if any one, suddenly seized by an evil whimsy,
should desire to make this good old man of the great
century responsible for our short commons.</p>

<p>The major in command at headquarters in Ingolstadt,
on the other hand, who must be a jingo of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
most pronounced type, is prodigal of petty vexations.
He forbids tobacco, chocolate, and sugar, “articles of
luxury.” He forbids the foundation of a canteen; he
forbids the receipt of more than ten marks at a time,
and the writing of more than one letter every ten days;
he forbids pen and ink; he forbids access to the
escarp and to the summit of the slopes, doubtless considering
the view too beautiful for prisoners of war.
He issues orders that the sentinels shall fire without
challenge upon any who break his rules, and it was
owing to this that Georg, being taken for a Frenchman,
was shot at one evening in the gloaming.
Every day a new <i>Verboten</i> is issued.</p>

<p>Amid this maze of prohibitions, our life would be a
torture but for Baron von Stengel. Discreet and tactful
as he is, those among us who come into close contact
with him know with how much disgust, with how much
suppressed annoyance, he receives these vexatious
orders. He carries them out, being too good a soldier
to disobey. But, too good a soldier to misuse soldiers,
too much of a gentleman to treat as galley-slaves combatants
seamed with wounds, holy priests, red cross
men who have received their baptism of fire, he often
carries out his orders in a way which is tantamount to a
generous evasion.</p>

<p>He is an adept in the art of humanizing his agents,
the <i>Feldwebel</i> and the soldiers of the Bavarian guard.
Unfortunately these are changed every week, and every
week therefore he has to begin this civilizing task anew.
The men come to us white hot from reading the newspapers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
in savage mood—“duty, duty.” For two days
the fort is an inferno. Then everything returns to
order—not German order, but our own. Their zeal is
mitigated when they take note of the way in which the
commandant treats us. Our hail-fellow-well-met air,
our good-humoured cheek, do the rest. The soldiers
are tamed. Soon they cease to guard us; they contemplate
us, and take part in our life. There they
stand, with fixed bayonets, somewhat nonplussed and
puzzled, almost timid, abashed as it were, hardly knowing,
when we dig them in the ribs, whether we are fond
of them or are making fun of them. At bottom they
feel themselves to be our inferiors, less lively and less
intelligent. They all have much the same idea as fat
Max, the canteen keeper, who secretly breaks the pumps
whenever a fresh levy is being made, in order to render
himself more indispensable here than at the front. In
view of the activity of our comrades, their carvings in
wood and in stone, the tin rings they make, the horsehair
watch-chains, the stools, tables, and cupboards
which they knock together out of bits of planking
filched from the workyards at Ingolstadt, this mighty
beer-drinker is unable to control his astonishment.
He waves his great arms, exclaiming:</p>

<p>“These Frenchmen, what workers! I’ve always maintained,
<i>Herr Gott Sakrament</i>, that every one of them
has a devil in his inside.”</p>

<p>M. von Stengel is of much the same way of thinking
as Max.</p>

<p>Little as he seems to notice, wishing, as he does,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
to avoid having to allot punishment, hardly anything
happens in the fort without his being aware of it.
Nothing licit or illicit escapes his keen gaze, and what
he does not see he divines. Nevertheless, with the
roguish indulgence of a grand seigneur, he is careful to
avoid any display of anger. I am confident that he
derives a good deal of secret enjoyment from the
contemplation of the network of customs, subterfuges,
and evasions, whose threads are interwoven behind the
iron grating of German regulations. He watches with
amusement the supple boldness with which prudent
advances are made, the care with which direct conflict
with authority is avoided, and the ingenuity with which
the regulations are taken in the flank, circumvented,
or ignored. He admires the stratagems by means of
which this miniature France, prisoned in a foreign fortress,
is enabled to reintegrate the life of the homeland.
He does not fail to recognize that these breaches of
discipline serve, even more clearly than the ingenuity
with which the breaches are effected, to manifest the
hardihood of his prisoners, and to prove their possession
of an individuality at once gentle and intractable.</p>

<p>This German, at any rate, does not regard the French
as “monkeys.” He is not misled by their superficial
levity, their suppleness, their apparent scepticism—shining
armour with which they protect their ego, a
vivacious and rebellious ego, which resists everything,
which always gets even, is ever elastic, artful, or frank,
as circumstances prescribe, but immalleable, incapable
of being passive, obstinately itself. The commandant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
is impressed with the fact that the Frenchman is what
he is and remains what he is, jealous of his privacy,
greatly prizing his own humour, tastes, and ideas. It
may be that M. von Stengel considers that we are
excessively individualized, that whilst we often seem to
treat grave matters as trifles, the least onslaught upon
our intimate personality arouses in us an excess of fury,
a revolt which may go so far as to compromise the
collective interest. But it is certain that he knows us
and accepts us as we are. He imposes no constraint,
and has no desire to refashion us after the Teuton
model. It is even possible that he regards with secret
approval the delicate compost of national merits and
peculiarities. In any case, in his relations with us he
is extremely careful to do everything he can to blunt
the sharp, harassing, and painful angles of Germanic
discipline.</p>

<p>Nevertheless this man, so sensible, moderate, and
well-bred, does not possess a perfectly unified character.
One recognizes in him both the German and the natural
man. The former enunciates cynical maxims to the
latter, insisting, for example, upon the value of war for
war’s sake. The latter listens, but shies at the idea.
It is as if, while enjoying the refined sweetness of a
French morning, he should suddenly be disturbed by
the horrid bellowing of all the war-horns of the Huns.
The dicta of this brutal philosophy rack his ears. But,
being good-mannered, he hearkens. His brother seems
to him a thick-skinned fellow, coarse-blooded, grim, and
savage-hearted. However, he makes no protest. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
brother reiterates his statements, repeats his massive
assertions loudly and unceasingly, and insists upon
agreement. He has to pay for being well-mannered,
for hating scenes, for disliking to give pain. From very
kindness of heart, from love of peace, from very
sensitiveness, he assumes a barbaric mask. The good
brother! It goes much against the grain, but he gives
an apparent assent.</p>

<p>It is thanks to a series of such sacrifices, invariably
one-sided, that the German and the natural man
seem, in Baron von Stengel, to live on harmonious
terms.</p>

<p>His natural man is good and just. Making no parade
of humanitarian convictions, he practises humaneness.</p>

<p>It is touching to watch this grand old man, lofty of
stature, with a solid prognathous chin, irreproachably
dressed, when he stops to speak to a soldier suffering
from despondency. “Fous êtes triste?” he asks in his
slow and broken French, gently pulling the man by the
ear. The prisoner does not misunderstand; he knows
that though the major can read French he is unable
to speak it, and that in this laconic phrase he desires to
condense an entire friendly conversation.</p>

<p>A few days ago, having learned that a loaf of bread
priced at thirty pfennig had been sold at one mark
fifty pfennig to a prisoner by a soldier of the guard,
he was greatly enraged, and in the presence of Durupt,
who was helping him to write up the register of money
orders, he exclaimed, “There is but one price for bread,
and I shall proceed with the utmost rigour against anyone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
be he French or German, who asks a higher price.
It is disgraceful to rob prisoners in this way!” The
joke is that officially we are not supposed to buy anything
at all.</p>

<p>The day before yesterday there was a fall of sleet.
The men were loitering up and down the corridors. In
front of the <i>Kommandantur</i> there was a great clatter
of hobnailed shoes, and the noise was reinforced by light
songs, laughter, and chatter. The commandant was
reading our eleven hundred letters. Two days earlier
he had sent them to Ingolstadt. Headquarters, cantankerous
as usual, had returned them, under some
pretext, to be re-read. This was something calculated to
put the gentlest of men out of humour. Scrupulously
obedient to orders, he was now for the second time
reading these poor papers, badly written in pencil,
insipid, and all exactly alike. On the other side of the
door, the procession of prisoners passed and repassed
unceasingly. The clatter of nails on the cement got on
his nerves. “Oh, the noise, the noise!” he said, as if
speaking to himself. D’Arnoult was there and rose
from his seat, intending to ask the comrades to be a
little quieter. The commandant stopped him, saying,
“No, monsieur d’Arnoult, do not go out. <i>Mein
Zimmer ist doch nur eine Kanzlei</i>—after all, my room
is only an office!” And once more he immersed himself
in his reading.</p>

<p>Withal, in the major’s innermost being, the natural
man invariably acts and governs. The other, the
German, merely utters professions of faith.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>Out walking, just now, we had paused for a moment,
dazzled by the beauty of the evening. We were on the
strip of greyish-white pasture which arches along the
edge of the pine wood, and looked like the woolly back
of a sheep. Before us, seemingly at our very feet, the
Danubian plain, with its gentle undulations, stretched
away through the iridescent haze. The sun had just
set. A breeze was blowing from the west, chasing
before it golden mist-wreaths. The branches and faded
foliage of the oaks, dry and nipped by the frost, rustled
in the chill wind; the pine needles, interlaced with
gossamer, reddened by many sunsets, whispered and
murmured. We were a silent company, Baron von
Stengel, Major Langlois, MM. Jeandidier, Cavaillé,
Lœbre, Romant, Bouvat, my friend Laloux, and
myself. The vastness of the prospect, the silence
of the fields, the fading of the light, the shivering
of the undergrowth in the twilight, the strange
sensation of being suddenly plunged into the heart
of winter—all these influences combined to keep us
mute.</p>

<p>What a waste of time! I thought. Already three
months in prison. Three months lost beyond recall.
And the baron had just said to me, “England is intractable.
I hardly think you will get away before next
autumn.” More than a year lived through for nothing,
suffered for nothing. A whole year cut out from the
short span of our days. I was prey to a cold, hard
sadness. Then, my thoughts turned to you.…
All at once a song rose from the road. The recruits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
quartered at Hepperg were returning to quarters,
marching with that slow and heavy German pace which
will never be a match for our French step.</p>

<p>They were singing the famous</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Nun ade, wir müssen Abschied nehmen.…</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">with which all the <i>Feldgrau</i>, before going to the front,
have made the quiet Bavarian taverns ring, sitting over
their great tankards, each holding the beloved one’s
hand. I was familiar with the strains. The little
sergeant of whom I have previously written to you
had made his men sing it to me one evening in the
guardroom, and had copied out the text for me:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Now farewell. We must take leave. We must charge
our muskets. With stout hearts we shall give to the war
and to the fields of battle the finest days of our youth.
Farewell, dear parents, brothers, and sisters. Shake hands
for the last time. If we are never to meet again, let us hope
for a reunion in a better world.</p>

<p>Farewell, best beloved, you who know that our parting
is harder to bear than death. It may be that we shall never
meet again. Yet every day, when night falls, let us renew
our hopes.</p>

<p>The shells are whistling through the air. The bayonets
are fixed. The flags are waving in the breeze. Our dread
is concealed beneath the smoke of the combat. As we fight
we cry, hurrah, hurrah!</p>

<p>We are in the thick of it, like good Bavarians.</p>

</div>

<p>“What are you thinking about, my dear enemy?”
said von Stengel all at once with a smile.—“<i>Herr
Kommandant</i>,” I replied, in an access of dull rage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
“<i>dieser Krieg wird die grosse Schande Europas
sein!</i>”<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>Slowly, to suit the baron, we descended the incline,
soft beneath our feet, the turf torn, and littered with
fragments of shell; here and there grew handsome
stone-pines with twisted trunks. Being unable to
run, I was shivering in my summer clothing. We
took the road beside the hop-garden, and as we
walked the baron gave me his views upon the war.</p>

<p>In truth, all he did was to repeat the words of
Harnack, Lujo Brentano, Troeltsch, Willamovitz-Moellendorff,
and the hundred representatives of
German Kultur. As I listened, I seemed to be re-reading
the articles which these writers were now publishing in
the war editions of the <i>Internationale Monatsschrift</i>:</p>

<p>“Germany has never desired anything but peace;
William is the peace emperor; Sir Edward Grey is
the villain of the drama; English commercialism
led to the war; Germany was suddenly seized by the
throat and had to defend herself; she is engaged in a
life and death struggle.…</p>

<p>“<i>Ueber welches Volk wird einst das Tribunal der
Weltgeschichte den Urteilsspruch ‘Schuldig’ fallen?
Eins ist gewiss! Deutschland kann dem Urteilsspruch
mit reinem Gewissen entgegen sehen.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>I had no interest in all this. If the major had been
a man of my own age, I should have bluntly begged
him to spare me these phrases of the good bourgeois
who has just been reading the newspapers. I should
have said to him: “In actual fact, our respective
countries are at war. Let us leave it to our grandchildren,
should they have a fancy for writing history,
to ascertain who is responsible for this butchery. But
as far as I am myself concerned, be good enough to
consider me a man of sound intelligence, and don’t
attempt to befool me with your political myths. I
agree that these myths have their uses, and that they
are necessary for the soldier. To him one must lie
perforce. Above all, in our democratic epoch, the
violent man does wisely to wear sheep’s clothing,
and to give himself the air of defending civilization
and humanity, for otherwise the citizen would never
be willing to play the part of soldier. If needs must,
the citizen will allow himself to be killed for the sake
of principles, or in defence of hearth and home, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
never for the interest of the Hapsburgs, the Hohenzollerns,
or a business corporation. Agreed, the
aggressor must lie.</p>

<p>“But we are not now on a public platform; we
are not composing a proclamation. Do not let us
deceive ourselves, nor soil our minds with a superfluous
falsehood.”</p>

<p>But to this old man I said nothing of the sort. I
listened patiently. The wind bit my ears, and my
body seemed a vast Siberia. As I walked, I looked
at the birches, each one of which was known to me
individually. Their delicate ramifications, now leafless,
hung like horses’ manes. But the youngest trees, those
whose tresses were not yet grown, so that their branches
pointed directly upwards like the twigs of an ill-made
besom, still retained some sparse foliage. In the icy
wind, the white of their stems standing out against
the greenish-black of the acacias in the ditch had
a somewhat funereal air.</p>

<p>“War,” said von Stengel, “is an essential condition
of social life. Without war, the human race would
become anæmic, would slip back into barbarism,
ignorance, and hebetude. Even though man loves
peace, he must also be a great fighter before the
Lord, <i>ein Streiter vor dem Herrn</i>. Do not imagine
that wars are the work of a few men; the ferment
works in the very heart of the race, and when this
happens the maintenance of peace becomes impossible.
The friction is so great, the heat generated is
so intense, that the flames burst forth spontaneously.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
Then patience is out of place, and it is necessary to
unsheathe the sword. Blood, much blood, must flow
to appease the fierce angers and to restore men to
their customary calm.”</p>

<p>It was the German in Baron von Stengel, not the
man, who spoke, enunciating the doctrine that war is
necessary, that war is a natural function of social life.</p>

<p>“For the rest,” he added, humanizing to the best of
his ability the myth formulated by the German, for now
the natural man was resuming sway, “once war has
broken out, it is the duty of us all to do our best
to diminish its horrors. Men differ widely, and yet,
through contact with upright and noble characters,
even the worst of human beings, even those of malignant
and dark nature, come to learn the value of
peace, of good understanding, and acquire the faculty
of enduring with equanimity.”</p>

<p>Thus talking, we reached the great iron gate, adorned
with the Bavarian lions. I rang. The gate was opened,
the baron drew aside to allow his “boarders” to
pass in, and these in turn signalled to him to take
precedence.</p>

<p>The commandant major, Baron Stefan von Stengel,
very erect, head held high, passed through the gateway.
The guard, fully armed, stood at attention, lined up in
two rows. Upon an order from the <i>Feldwebel</i>, “<i>Hurrah
für den Major</i>,” twenty recruits shouted with a single
voice. Night had fallen. All the windows of the fort,
which had been invisible as long as we were outside the
walls, were now seen to be lighted up, and the red of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
the bricks was manifest in the starlight. We crossed
the drawbridge. “Now that the snows have come,”
said the commandant, pointing to the ditch, “we could
make a good skating-rink there.” He saluted, and
withdrew into his casemate.</p>

<p class="tb">As a matter of fact, I have not entirely lost
my time here, since I have succeeded in classifying
adequately in the social hierarchy such a man as Baron
von Stengel, who is neither hero nor genius, who has
no ambition to display supernatural virtues, but who is
simply a man with pleasant manners, refined, well-bred,
free from all stiffness, easy to get on with, a
truly civilized being.</p>

<p>You, my friends, have spoiled me. It is owing to
you that I had always remained ignorant how restricted
is the genus of “decent folk.” The war has changed
my views in this respect. Hardened, simplified, freer
in relation to external conditions, as adaptable as
any one could wish—when the campaign is over I
shall be somewhat less confiding than of yore towards
my kind. Now that I sample them in the mass,
elbowing them unceasingly morning, noon, and night
throughout the entire day of twenty-four hours, listening
to them as they talk, chatter, grumble, quarrel,
and snore, looking on at them while they enjoy
themselves, complain, play, eat, bargain, pull
out the personal stop, pass judgments, take things at
their ease; now that I no longer contemplate them
through the prism of my doctrines and of my leniency,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
but look at them as they really are, all the scenery
of civil life removed, all social trappings stripped
off—there are certain categories of mind which I
understand better than before. I understand better,
for example, hermits, misanthropes, jansenists, and all
pessimists, pagan as well as Christian, all those who
can see nothing in man but the primitive beast, and
those who never cease talking of original sin. How
greatly now do I prize good manners, the veneer of
culture, the mask of decency. These are but externals,
things which do not give expression to man’s intimate
nature. They even aim at veiling that nature.
But precisely because they exercise this occlusive
and embellishing function, they seem to me august.
The sight of the real arouses an appetite for
fiction, creates a necessity for art and for dreams.
Are these lies? Yes, they are lies, poor lies! What
matter? Must we live in hell by deliberate choice?
It cannot be asserted that such illusions make a
paradise of our ill-conditioned and sordid world;
but at least they mitigate the stench to some extent,
neutralize its offensiveness, and render the bestial
hustle a thought less aggressive.</p>

<p>My nose is still uneasy with the memory of the
carrion odour from the battlefields of Moncourt, Lagarde,
and Kerprich. It was here that I learned the
value of shroud, coffin, quicklime, and tomb. Now
that I have come to know men better, I know also
that the trifling restraints and delicate veils of conventional
good manners are absolutely essential.</p>

<h2 id="THE_SLOPES_ARE_FORBIDDEN">THE SLOPES ARE FORBIDDEN</h2>

<p class="right"><i>November 20, 1914.</i></p>

<p>Snow has been falling throughout the night. Risking
a shot, for the new orders from headquarters are
still more stringent, I walked for a good hour at
dawn upon the northern ramparts. When the sun
rose over the village of Hepperg there was sketched
in the opposite quarter, towards France, in three
strokes of the brush, the most striking of pastels:
in the foreground, the old gold of the oaks, flaming,
sanguine, and burnished: in the middle distance, the
wide field of virgin snow; in the background, the
heavy and sombre line of the pines, interspersed with
larches, sparkling with hoar-frost.</p>

<p>Solitude amid inanimate things, in the morning,
restores me to the tranquil possession of myself,
induces a peaceful, strong, and simple happiness which
neither the society of my fellows, nor meditation, nor
prayer can ever furnish. At one time this calm, as
of Eden, used to terrify me. It seemed to me impious.
When, as a youth, I loitered among the wild oak-groves
which form scattered oases amid the limestone
mazes of Païolive in Vivarais, it seemed to me that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
their shade was stifling my faith, that the seated
giants of white stone, amid which the Ardèche has
hollowed its precipitous channel, were swallowing my
Christian dogmas, and that my Eliacin-like fervours
were evaporating into the torrid sky, passing upward
with the furnace breath which rises in summer from
this formidable landscape.</p>

<p>Since then, however, I have learned to feel no doubt
regarding the primacy of man vis-à-vis the grandeur
of inanimate things.</p>

<p>No, my delight in natural scenery is by no means
pantheistic. I believe too firmly in the hierarchy of
creation, and I am too strongly imbued with the
Christian conception that man is a person, as it were
a son of God, an absolute individuality, inviolable,
raised above life and death, to be able to lose my
sense of personal identity in the contemplation of
rocks, fields, and woodlands. It is simply that I love
fresh air and open spaces; I love the lineaments of
nature, which are more beautiful than the doings of
men; I love the society of the meadows and of the
trees, a society which is less importunate and talkative
than that of my fellows, and which never fails to
restore me to myself. Perhaps, moreover, I tend instinctively
to idolize colour and light, seeing that God
has concentrated in my eyes, above all, the power of
sensuous appreciation.</p>

<p>This morning I was interested in watching the
gambols of an ermine which had just captured a
small black mammal. Supple, slim, and snake-like,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
it sat up from time to time to look around. It was
hard to distinguish, despite its black tail-tip, from the
surrounding snow, though this had a bluish tint in
contrast with the ermine’s fur, in which there were
subtle shades of green. I stood motionless on the
footpath, wrapped in the soft cloak which Mme. Paul
Weiss has just sent me. The little beast advanced
fearlessly towards me, joyously shaking the prey that
it carried in its jaws. Did it take me for a tree?</p>

<p>I move my barberry switch. The ermine stops.
Sitting up, it looks at me for a long time. How pretty
it is, slender and graceful! I think of Musette, a
black English greyhound, with perfect points, which
won the first prize at Lyons, and was the delight of
my eyes for three years. Dear Musette! We were
always together. The first time we were parted she
died. Madeleine, my favourite little sister, was charged
with giving me the news. She wrote me a letter of
eight pages. I still recall her great childish handwriting.
Her kind heart had inspired the most
touching precautions, and suggested the use of angelic
phraseology. “We have buried her,” she wrote in
conclusion, “in that corner of the garden you are
so fond of, beneath the oleanders.”</p>

<p>I continue to look at the ermine, but the animal
is doubtless ready for breakfast. Evading the danger,
it descends the slope, gains the traverse, and runs
restlessly to and fro. I trouble it. Most probably I
am between it and its earth. I go.</p>

<p>As I make my way on to the escarp I meet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
Noverraz, the Parisian, the hero of the look-out
episode. He is taking a constitutional in the snow.
His waxen skin, pinched by the cold, has red patches
on it. His ears and the tip of his nose are scarlet.</p>

<p>“Where have you been?” he inquires.</p>

<p>“Beyond the slopes. I must have walked quite a
league this morning. It was glorious!”</p>

<p>“Take care, old chap, if you value a whole skin.”</p>

<p>“Bah!”</p>

<p>“My dear fellow, this is what happened to me on
Thursday morning. It must have been about half-past
eight. I am taking a walk with my chums of
casemate 23. There is a regular London fog. All
at once, at the bottom of the west court, we hear the
jabber of Boche. I imagine that it is the disciplinary
company breaking stones, as usual, in front of the
battery. Durand, however, clambers up the slope.
After peering over the edge, he makes signs to us
to join him. On the road that runs by the ditch
are two sections, standing at ease in columns of
fours. Their officer is on horseback, wearing a huge
grey cloak. He is making a speech to his men.
My attention is riveted by the word <i>Frankreich</i>.
I scramble a little higher. Stretched at full length,
my head just above the edge, among the grass, I listen
with all my ears: ‘Get this firmly fixed in your
minds,’ says the captain, ‘for we must not fail to
learn all we can from these French rascals [<i>diese
Lumpen von Franzosen</i>]. Let me repeat: they climb
into the trees; they install their machine guns among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
the branches; they wait there in absolute silence. The
German scouts have examined the ground only. Our
men pass by. Then comes a sound like thunder!
We are mowed down from behind by a rain of bullets.
Such are the tricks of these monkeys! Well, let us
meet ruse by ruse, stratagem by stratagem. Listen
carefully. You are at the front. You dig your trench,
the admirable German trench. You settle yourself
there comfortably. You are invulnerable. Thence,
quite at your ease and without danger, you can fire
at the French lines. Is this all? No. In advance
of your real trench, eighty or a hundred yards away,
you hastily dig another trench. You fill it with
dummies. It is quite easy—any old rags of clothing
will do. These pigs of Frenchmen [<i>diese Sauleute</i>,
<i>dieses Schweinvolk</i>] can fire at this as long as they
please. Then, when the assault comes, when they rush
into this hole thinking that they’ve got you, you have
an admirable target, at short range, and you can quietly
exterminate them.’</p>

<p>“Such are the officer’s words. At this moment one
of his men asks a question, and I take the opportunity
of changing my position, so that I am exposed
down to the waist. The captain catches sight of me.
After glaring at me for a moment, he demands a rifle,
shoulders it, and fires. Nothing happens; the breech is
empty. We do not budge. The captain is furious.
‘Give me a cartridge!’ He loads the rifle and
shoulders it once more. My comrades and I are
about to take cover behind the slope when the shot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
is fired. It must be a blank cartridge, for we hear
no whistle of a bullet. The Boches burst out laughing.
Corporal Durand, standing erect with folded arms,
gazes at them mockingly. He intends to stay there.
‘My good man,’ I exclaim, ‘hurry up and get down!’
The captain is asking for another cartridge. ‘This
time,’ I say, ‘it will probably be a bullet!’</p>

<p>“There you have it. This is exactly what happened.
I did not lose a word or a gesture. You had better
be careful. With your mania for ranging the outer
regions of the fort, you will get your skin perforated
one fine morning.”</p>

<h2 id="A_BLACK_MOOD">A BLACK MOOD</h2>

<p class="right"><i>November 27, 1914.</i></p>

<p>A prey to depression, we are smoking in the “Salle
du Jeu de Paume.” Laloux and Badoy, otherwise
known as Badozus, are playing an interminable game
of chess; d’Arnoult is reading Victor Hugo’s <i>Histoire
d’un crime</i>; Noverraz is dozing over Balzac’s <i>Chouans</i>;
Sergeant Scherrer, tall and thin, with cold eye and
Mephistophelian head, is playing draughts with Massé,
a non-commissioned officer of artillery. Seated upon
the drawers of the drug cupboard, they are crowded
round the solitary lamp. The table is of deal, oblong
in shape, one that can be used as an operating-table.
Their heads are in shadow. Elbow to elbow and forehead
to forehead, the six men are silent. The circle
of light is hazy with blue whorls rising from their
pipes.</p>

<p>Standing in the embrasure of the window, I am
smoking my own Bavarian pipe. There is not a
sound in the room, nor in the passages, nor on the
bridge close to our windows. Depression must reign
supreme throughout the casemates, depression which
paralyses mind and body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>How intense is the tedium, uncertainty, and anxiety!
No letter for a whole fortnight. Yet she must be
writing to me. And Léonce, my dear young brother.
I wonder if it is as cold in the trenches at Ypres as
it is in Bavaria. Shrapnel, bullets, sudden death.
Shall I ever see him again? Is he still alive? Manech,
the amiable corporal of No. 13, forty-two of whose
Breton relatives have been engaged on the land front
or at sea, has already lost six of them. The fighting
priest, Gautin, has learned that the body of his
brother lies rotting on the banks of the Marne.
Sergeant Boullanger is mourning his father. Since
we have begun to receive letters, almost every one is
in mourning. Can it be that my own melancholy is
a presentiment? When will it end, this sinister interlude
in the book of peace, our book, our true book,
the book of humanity?</p>

<p>Noverraz has fallen asleep over the <i>Chouans</i>;
d’Arnoult, “le Chasseur,” has closed <i>Histoire d’un
crime</i>. He stretches and yawns. The others,
huddled together, move their pieces without saying
a word.</p>

<p>It is cold. All our thoughts ooze despondency.
This brute of a major at headquarters who, meanly,
by way of reprisal, has been detaining our letters at
Ingolstadt for the last fortnight! Why cannot I
throw off my troubles? This evening I am like a
child, like a neglected schoolboy who has ceased to
hear from his mother.</p>

<p>France, Paris, a blazing wood-fire in my study;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
Douchka and Katia asleep on the hearthrug. She is
there!</p>

<p>No, I am in Bavaria. I am a prisoner. I am at
Fort Orff, at the edge of the Swabian forest, among
gloomy villages where I know no one, where they
believe that we are slaughtering their sons with
dum-dum bullets, and that we were the aggressors.
A Franconian blackguard is the man who feeds
me. Then there is a little good-for-nothing schoolmaster
from Hof, a pedant stuffed with German
idealism, who appeals to honour and humanity in
season and out of season, who, having caught <i>flagrante
delicto</i> a weaver of watch-chains snatching a
few hairs from a horse’s tail, gives him three days’
close arrest, saying gravely, “A most inhumane act”—and
it is this whipper-snapper, this round-shouldered
and short-sighted impotent beast, who is my <i>Feldwebel</i>,
“my superior officer”! He is a mean creature.
Knowing that I am on good terms with von Stengel,
he begged Dutrex to present me. Dutrex did so,
saying: “<i>Hier ist unser Schriftsteller</i> [This is our
author]”—“I am much honoured, monsieur; I have
read an article on you in the <i>Nürnberger Zeitung</i>.”
He bowed and scraped again and again. He stood
there, his ugly little moustache bristling with smiles,
looking as great a booby as if he had been before
the commandant. The quartermaster is a bad lot,
but the <i>Feldwebel</i> is grotesque. And I am dependent
upon the caprices of such men! I am a thing in the
hands of these contemptible fellows, these hypocrites,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
who loudly voice their patriotism and boast of the
German virtues, while they are shamming rheumatism
and heart-weakness to avoid being sent to the
fighting-line. Sometimes I am seized with a longing
to spit out my contempt in their very faces. Before
Baron von Stengel one feels like a man; a noble
master ennobles those subject to his orders. But
before these subordinates all human nobility withers,
wretched instruments who treat us as instruments in
turn. Empowered to dominate and to humiliate us,
to abuse us as much as they please, their favours are
even worse than their severities; it is the brutal landowner
in Latium amusing himself with a Græculus;
it is the <i>Donaubauer</i>, the fat Danubian peasant,
caressing his dog. I prefer their hatred.</p>

<p class="tb">The good Badoy, with his huge round head, his
snub nose, his little curly beard, his large fatherly
eyes, bends forward over the board, humps his back,
and clenches his fists between his short legs, saying:</p>

<p>“When will it come to an end?”</p>

<p>“Which, the game or the imprisonment?” asks
Laloux quietly, as he takes Badoy’s queen.</p>

<p>“How can you ask?” Then, as if speaking to himself:
“Oh! my wife and my three little ones, when
shall I see them again? Still no letters! It’s
terrible.”</p>

<p>From my corner in the window I contemplate the
circle of smoke and of light, and I look at these six
men packed together, chilly and sad. I dare not open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
my lips. My depression is turning to gall. I am
not far, this evening, from understanding certain scenes
in the casemates which had astonished me, when taciturn
men became suddenly exasperated, and, for a
single word, hurled themselves on one another, fighting
like horses without oats in a stable. Poor caged
beasts! The others, at least, those in Flanders
and in France, have room to move. They have
an object for action. After the stagnation of the
trenches they can assuage their anger in the fury of
the assault. But as for us, heavy with wrath, we are
confined within thick walls; we can but swing our
frozen and idle arms; we are cut off from all news;
we are the prey of dreams and of hunger. Outside
the screened window, the ditch, the counterscarp,
and the grating; outside the grating, a Bavarian
bayonet marches to and fro.</p>

<p>What can account for this state of nerves which I
am unable to control? The hour for the arrival of the
postman has passed. I have been waiting all day. It
has passed. There is nothing. I ought to be able to
find a reason. Why am I outwardly so hard and
inwardly near to weeping? Suddenly there come
great silent waves of memory. I hear her singing.
She is dressed in green. The dark perfume of her
golden hair enwraps me. The melody of César
Franck’s <i>Procession</i> rises athwart my fever; it is broad,
sweet, richer and more peaceful than a field of ripe
wheat upon a warm evening. It sings within me; it
assumes the cadence of my breathing. I am stifling.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
I live, I love, and I am loved; and yet I am thrust
out from life as if I were in the tomb.</p>

<p>Elbow to elbow and forehead to forehead, the six
men at the table are silent. I look down upon the
circle of light and the smoke of the pipes. Not a
sound is to be heard. Buried in the mound, surrounded
by meadows and woods, the fort is as cold and mute,
as remote, desolate, and dead, as a soldier’s grave in
the corner of a field.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="A_FRANCONIAN_QUARTERMASTER">A FRANCONIAN QUARTERMASTER</h2>

<p class="right"><i>December 4, 1914.</i></p>

<p>The “Salle du Jeu de Paume” was born, if I may use
the expression, from a conjunction of coups d’état.</p>

<p>Day by day the quartermaster became more exasperated
at the happiness of five Frenchmen. In accordance
with the good German rules, they ought to have
been sleeping upon the damp cement in the basement,
which is really a dungeon. But since we have had
palliasses, the house-surgeon, the apothecary, and their
friends—Laloux, Badoy, Scherrer, Massé, and Noverraz—have
been sleeping in the consulting-room, where
they are masters. This first-floor casemate, adjoining
the <i>Kommandantur</i>, is dry, has a boarded floor and a
southern aspect. Every evening they made their beds
side by side and slept the sleep of the just. M. von
Stengel good-naturedly closed his eyes. The Bavarian
guard, grateful for the castor oil and the cuppings of
Laloux, did likewise. But Ploss, the reservist quartermaster,
a Franconian stonemason who speaks of
himself as a “sculptor in the building trade,” was scandalized.
He is a patriot, a flaming patriot—except<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
where his own skin is concerned. Called to the front
a few weeks ago, he went to weep upon the commandant’s
bosom. The weeping gained its end, and
he is still at Fort Orff.</p>

<p>Frenchmen sleeping dry, with plenty of room! Five
Frenchmen bedded in a spacious casemate! Frenchmen
passing night and day in the next room to the
<i>Kommandantur</i>! Ploss’ soul was desolate.</p>

<p>One morning he went to see Baron von Stengel, and
declared that the casemate of the guard, which adjoins
on the west the commandant’s casemate, was too small,
and that it was essential to use the consulting-room as
an overflow. The consulting-room, divided in two by
a wooden partition, could serve as a sort of office for
the <i>Feldwebel</i> and for himself, the quartermaster; thus
the faithful <i>Landwehrleute</i> would have the delight of
guarding their dear <i>Herr Major</i> on both sides. The
argument was irresistible. The <i>Herr Major</i> acquiesced.
Intoxicated with delight, Ploss promptly went up and
down the fort announcing the news everywhere, to the
guard, to the interpreters, and to the banished men.
Prouder even than M. de Morny after the 2nd of
December, he luxuriated in his coup d’état.</p>

<p>The door of the room occupied by the six French
medical officers opens into the same corridor as the
<i>Kommandantur</i>, but on the other side of the main
entrance. Laloux and his companions promptly go to
knock at the door. They explain the situation. Next
minute, M. Langlois, in full dress, wearing gloves,
emerges. He descends upon M. von Stengel. He has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
the most pressing need of a consulting-room, spacious,
airy, and sunny! He is crafty, and as persistent as he
is diplomatic. The baron agrees to let him have
No. 46, the next room to the French officers. An
obstinate defender of our rights, he demands in addition
that the members of his staff, who give their
services to French and Germans alike, shall have
permission to sleep in their workroom. Permission is
granted. He returns. Our exiles, whistling and singing
joyously, hasten to remove their palliasses. Ploss
watches them sourly; his coup d’état has missed fire.
These French monkeys, they always fall on their feet!
But what sort of a <i>Herr Major</i> is this, who can refuse
them nothing?</p>

<p>Downstairs, in kitchen No. 22, another turn of fortune’s
wheel! The major from the Ingolstadt headquarters,
who is but a Ploss with a commission, has
been inspecting the fort, and has caught sight of the
twin palliasses of Dutrex and Riou. Placed against
the wall opposite the stoves, they have been an offence
to him. “Clear out, messieurs!” What are we to do?
Our places have been filled in our old casemates. We,
too, visit M. Langlois. Hitting two birds with one
stone, he includes us, as well as Durupt, the money-changer,
d’Arnoult, the secretary, and Détry, the
dentist, in his request to M. von Stengel. Thus the
entire pharmaceutical staff and the whole French
bureaucracy of Fort Orff are assigned to the consulting-room.</p>

<p>This happened ten days ago. Since then the victims<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
of the two coups d’état have furnished their quarters.
They have adorned their windows with half curtains
and have divided their casemate in two with a hanging
of flowered lutestring. During the day they arrange
their ten palliasses in two piles and cover them with
rugs, so that in hours of despondency they have two
imposing couches—thrones, as it were. At the very
end of the room are the two tables, the one known
as the “operating-table,” and the little table whose
heavy drawers contain iodine, cupping-glasses, and blue
ointment. At their request, Le Second has designed
for them shades “à la ballet russe” for their two lamps.
On the shelves they have arranged the vermicelli
boxes which they use as lockers. The men of room
26, a centre of artistic life, have made them some
additional shelves. An old herring-box plays the
part of flower-vase, filled at this moment with silver
thistles and a spray of barberry, magnificently red.
Ploss can’t get over it! His own “büro” is a
melancholy place. The old consulting-room, formerly
spruce and gay, has become a mere empty loft since
he took possession. <i>Herr Gott Sakrament!</i> Hang
these Frenchmen!</p>

<p>After dinner the medical officers, especially MM.
Langlois, Romant, and Bouvat, come to No. 46. We draw
back the curtains. We stretch a string across the room
to serve as net, and for an hour we give ourselves up to
the joys of chamber-tennis, using our hands as rackets.
It is for this reason that the new consulting-room has
received the imposing name of Salle du Jeu de Paume.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
Sometimes, also, it is designated “la chambre des
huiles,” <i>das Oelenzimmer</i>.</p>

<p>Poor Ploss. He cannot get the better of these
Frenchmen. He would like to see them yielding, to
see them cringe beneath his rod, to see them thoroughly
miserable. And yet, whatever he can do, despite their
hunger and their fits of the blues, they are cheerful.
They sing, they decorate their prison. They are
always finding new devices. If they have no tools,
they make some. They work unceasingly in wood and
stone. All the casemates have tables now, stools, chairs,
lockers, water-kegs, draughts, and chessmen. Guiton
d’Ancenis and Robert le Bordelais are neither smiths
nor carpenters, and yet No. 26 is well furnished. They
had no spoons; they “forged” some out of old “bully-beef”
tins. They had no forks, but they have cut some
from the birches on the slopes. To economize matches,
they have made a float-light. To save their fingers
from the heat of the boiling soup when it is poured
into their bowls, they have fashioned wickerwork
saucers. Almost all of them had been compelled to
give up their knives; lengths of iron cask-hoop,
patiently hammered straight and sharpened, have supplied
the lack. Their windows are decorated with tiny
pine-trees, planted in herring-boxes. They hope to
take them home and grow them in France.</p>

<p>Do what he could, Ploss has not been able to stamp
out this creative fervour. He knows it, and it infuriates
him. Oh, if he had but been commandant! How he
would have hunted down without mercy all those concerned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
in the underground traffic, in the great commercial
enterprises by which our illicit supply of provisions
has been gradually centralized. There are two such
enterprises, and thanks to the competition between
them we have for some weeks been securing, at stable
and almost reasonable prices, supplementary rations of
inestimable value. With what joy he would compel
Marin and Brissard to shut up shop, two men who,
with a chance armamentarium, have in kitchen No. 42
established a flourishing foundry of tin rings. And
Crussol, who puts the finishing touches to the stones
which are prepared for him by a whole squad of drillers
and escutcheoners, and who has secured a reputation
and customers even among the officers at the Ingolstadt
headquarters. How promptly would he be dislodged
from his niche in the northern parapet, where
he works all day in any weather, squatting and mute
like a second Paphnuce.</p>

<p>But, thank goodness, though Ploss can restrict as
much as he pleases the meagre governmental rations
(and he does not fail to make use of his opportunities
in this respect), his jurisdiction does not pass beyond
the limits of the storerooms and the kitchens. Throughout
the rest of the fort the major reigns supreme, and
his regime is so strictly courteous that even the most
ill-conditioned among the non-commissioned officers of
the guard think twice before ordering any of us strict
arrest on bread and water.</p>

<p>Ploss is disheartened. Ploss is wounded. Ploss is
sad. Ploss envies Fort A3, a German league from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
Fort Orff. Here a mere non-commissioned officer is in
command. The fort is in truth little more than a
redoubt. Two hundred and fifty Frenchmen of the
6th corps are packed into the place. Their only exercise
ground consists of muddy and dark passages, a
narrow ditch, and a tiny platform of about a hundred
square feet. There is no upper story. In front of
the windows, fifty yards away, are the iron gate and
the precipitous slope. Eternal twilight reigns within.
The governor is like a narrow-minded usher, a jealous
and timid despot, trembling before orders from headquarters
and terrible to the prisoners. If only Ploss
were <i>Vize-Feldwebel</i> of Fort A3!</p>

<p>I know this little fort. My friend Cambessédès,
house-surgeon from Paris, a doctor serving in M. Langlois’
group of stretcher-bearers, has been sent there
from Fort 8 as medical officer, accompanied by
M. Valois, a prosector from Montpellier. In a note,
clandestine, of course, he let us know his whereabouts.
Kindly, as usual, Baron von Stengel allowed the
medical officers and me to pay them a visit. Thus it
came to pass that last Sunday, escorted by a <i>Gefreiter</i>
and a soldier with fixed bayonet, we walked from Orff
to Wegstetten. It was thawing. Tiny blue rivulets
flowing through the pastures and along the furrows of
the ploughs reflected the quiet sky. We met groups
returning from vespers: women, children, and old men,
peaceful folk who nodded to us as they passed.</p>

<p>When we reach the fort, which is insidiously buried
in the interior of a bald eminence and is invisible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
a hundred paces away, a parley is necessary. The
<i>Gefreiter</i> hands the officer of the guard of A3 the
permit issued by the commandant of Fort Orff. The
sentry opens the gate. We pass in. Lining the walls,
the red-trousers form an inquisitive and saluting hedge.
Cambessédès runs up quite out of breath. Through
long, dark, and narrow passages he conducts us to the
medical officers’ quarters.</p>

<p>These are screened off by wooden partitions from the
remainder of a gloomy casemate. Two beds, two
wooden chairs, a table; no vacant space. It suggests
a midshipman’s cabin on a man-of-war. The air is raw.
Illustrations cut from the <i>Woche</i> are pinned to the wall.
Upon a little shelf above my friend’s bed I see his
wife’s photograph. A whiff of French perfume is
wafted to my senses. I think of Paris, home, the fireside,
work, peace! I say little during the visit. We
sit down haphazard on the beds, the chairs, the table.
A little soldier from Châlons, very quick and lively in
his movements, comes in with a jug of coffee and an
odd assortment of half-pint mugs. The company talks
of the Geneva Convention and of medical and technical
matters. Those from Orff get the others to tell of the
recent happenings at Fort 8.</p>

<p>I pay scant attention to these petty details, swallowing
my coffee mechanically amid the clash of voices
and laughter. All my thoughts are in Paris. How
strange seems this society of Frenchmen in the remote
Bavarian redoubt. It is borne in on me of a sudden
that madness rules the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>Cambessédès and Valois, as hosts, now show us
round. A crowd of soldiers follows us. Some of the
adjutants post us concerning the life of the prisoners.
Poor fellows, they have no von Stengel! In A3 it is
impossible to procure any kind of supplement to the
official rations. It is impossible to get a jug of good
beer from time to time to keep up one’s spirits.</p>

<p>From the platform there is a fine view over the
village of Wegstetten and the wood-crowned hills.
M. Langlois, at least, thinks so. He looks with all his
eyes. He is in ecstasy—when the sentry, a stumpy
Swabian in a black greatcoat which is threadbare,
weatherworn, and turning rusty-green, pounces upon
him, charges bayonet, and touches the major’s tunic with
the point of the steel. Our surgeon-in-chief protests:
he has made no attempt to climb up the turf-covered
breastwork; he has not trespassed into a forbidden
region; he has merely been admiring the view. “Quite
so,” barks the obstinate little bulldog, snorting angrily;
“to look outside is forbidden.”</p>

<p>Unquestionably A3 is very different from Fort Orff!
Whatever you do, baron-gaoler, do not ask for leave
until we are set at liberty. Do not hand us over to a
Ploss!</p>

<p>But even Ploss has his good hours. French lightness
of heart is able from time to time to exert its
charm over this hard Franconian noddle. His surly air
passes off. With a brisk gesture he pushes his greasy
<i>Mütze</i> back over the nape of his neck. His brown tuft
of hair makes its appearance, giving him an engaging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
and almost sportive air. During these calms, Davit, the
Hercules cook, can with impunity seize the quartermaster,
wrestle with him, and make as if to throw him
head-first into a boiling cauldron. The paunchy cook
of No. 42, when the herrings are being distributed, can
then, under Ploss’ very eyes, sneak a good-sized
“Bismarck” and stuff it into the pocket of his smock,
with the tail sticking out. But beware! The quartermaster’s
ordinary temper will suddenly return, and the
prisoner with whom he has just been laughing will find
himself sentenced to three days’ cells simply for having
kept up the game for a second after the eclipse. Ploss
is then capable of making allegations likely to bring a
man before a firing squad. He will say, for example,
“Prisoner X attempted to kill me by striking me on the
head with a ladle.”</p>

<p class="tb">What a wonderful thing is this French light-heartedness!
Heavy-witted northerners term it levity when
they should speak of it as vitality. These little
Frenchmen! To-day you see them sad at heart. The
weather is grey; a languorous humidity prevails which
seems to reduce the scale of the landscape and to make
the noises draw nearer. We hear the roar of the trains
in the plain, trains moving westwards, towards France.
Those afoot walk as in a dream; many never leave
their palliasses. The men from Provence are thinking
of the sunshine; the Parisians recall the joyous meetings
of Saturday evening when work is done; the
Bretons listen in imagination to the heavy, rhythmical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
sound of the great surges breaking at the foot of the
native cliff. Every one has “the hump.”</p>

<p>Suddenly comes the sound of singing from the
corridors. “They are singing! Have the letters
come?” One and all rush to be first at the main
gate, close to the <i>Kommandantur</i>, beneath the gloomy
arch. There is coming and going and much talk. “Is
it true that there are lots of letters?”—“Two or three
hundred, so d’Arnoult says!”—“What luck! When
shall we get them?”—“Oh, the sorting will take some
time.” The procession to the kitchens is animated.
The hope of being about to receive a letter has eased
the nervous tension.</p>

<p>But what, among eleven hundred men, is the handful
of letters reaching the fort from time to time? For
one who is made happy, there are thirty disappointed.
My friend Foch, the awe-inspiring sergeant of the
“vitriers” [infantry chasseurs], the most martial man in
the fort, a hero, has not yet received a single line from
Colroy-la-Grande, in the Vosges, near the Lubine pass.
Since August the French have been fighting on this
crest, advancing and retreating alternately. In the
frontier villages the skirmishing never ceases. What
has become of his brave wife, who, scorning bullets,
leading her seven-year-old twins by the hand, used to
bring dinner to her husband in the firing-line? Is she
dead? Has she been interned? And his house, the
little house known so well to the men of the 10th
Chasseurs, where they had often received food and
drink, is it still standing? Poor Foch! His energetic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
countenance, with its flashing eyes, is clouded; his
tongue, formerly so glib at a story, is stilled. Nor is he
the only one who continues to await the first letter from
home. I am among those specially favoured, and of ten
letters sent to me, but one comes to hand, taking three
and often four weeks on the journey.</p>

<p>Fortunately, money orders and parcels, exempt from
the delays of the censorship, arrive regularly. Received
as if they had been Father Christmas himself, with
transports of delight which well-nigh make us jump for
joy like children, these are the great dissipators of
depression. They have completely modified our life,
bringing into the fort a sort of plenty. Jerseys, woollen
helmets, Russian caps, comforters, thick hand-knitted
socks; every one is now wadded against the cold.
Muffled in wool, men toboggan merrily down the slopes.
Sometimes we have little dinner-parties. On the
rickety tables knocked together by our amateur
carpenters there are cups of tea and chocolate, pieces
of gingerbread, sponge-cakes, jams, long twists of
French tobacco. These love-feasts are not very grand,
but to us they are delightful. We nibble our piece of
cake, we sip from our steaming mug, noiselessly, slowly,
our hearts filled with tender thoughts. We think of the
hands which have made the tart, of the eyes which
have watched the seething of this jam. If one of the
guests should make a joke, he is wasting his wit. The
laugh dies on our lips. Every one is full of memories.
Our picnics are communions.</p>

<p>After the horror of the first two months of imprisonment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
when many of us knew no other feeling than that
of hunger—hunger by day and by night, the hunger that
keeps a man awake and gnaws like an ulcer—now
that winter has come we are having a fairly agreeable
time. Our bodies have become accustomed to the
regimen. The monotony of life is broken by happy
events, by the arrival of parcels, money orders, and
letters. The work we have had to do at Ingolstadt,
Hepperg, and Wegstetten has widened the bounds of
our prison. Every one has made a circle of friends.
Some of the casemates, with their tables for bridge or
poker, have now the aspect of clubs. We have learned
how to circumvent German discipline. Our service for
the supply of smuggled victuals works smoothly, so
that we are at least able to provide ourselves with
chocolate and tobacco. Some have purchased books;
numerous French works belonging to the Fayard,
Nelson, and Flammarion libraries have made their way
through the gates, across the ditches, and over the walls;
they pass from hand to hand until they fall to pieces.
Some of the prisoners are learning German. My big
dictionary is, as it were, an ever open mill, where all
can make themselves at home. Every room has its
writers of topical songs. Stretched on their palliasses,
paper and pencil in hand, they cudgel their brains for
rhymes. I cannot say that the outcome is sublime, but
the verses, caustic without ill-nature, peppered with
puns, and stuffed with allusions to the point of
unintelligibility, amuse us all. The following stanzas
dealing with the “ministerial council,” written by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
Cormarie and sung by Saint-Lanne of Agen at the

<p>But France is a nation of prose writers; at the fort
there are many more authors of memoirs than of songs.
Memoirs abound.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Why is it that men who have never
before tried to record their experiences in writing
should feel impelled to recount the happenings of their
campaign, and to describe their feelings of discouragement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
during a lengthy imprisonment? Do they do it
to relieve tedium? Have they an obscure need of
confession? Or do they consider the circumstances of
their life in war-time so exceptional as to deserve the
honour, in their view an extraordinary one, of written
record? In my opinion this last motive predominates.
Rightly or wrongly, the “little soldiers of the republic”
regard the present conflict in an epic light, and at
bottom, notwithstanding their ingrained tendency to
grumble, are not a little flattered at being among the
heroes of this affair. They know that as long as men
exist people will continue to talk about the great war,
and that in the schools children will learn the names of
the battles in which their fathers have fought and
suffered. They want to be able to astonish their little
ones, to be able to say: “I was there; I fought in this
battle; read my account of the matter and you will see
how everything happened, what my leaders did, and
when I received my wound.” Men, Frenchmen above
all, whatever their station, have such a hunger for
fame.</p>

<p>Yesterday I came across Maze on the slopes, wearing
his great red chéchia, which accentuates his stature,
already considerable. His shirt was drying in the
wind, tied to the lightning-conductor, and flapping like
a flag. He was sitting behind the parapet, sheltered
from the wind, and was reading. “What may you be
reading?”—“My battle.”—“Can I look at it?”—“Here
you are.”</p>

<p>In his note-book, worn and dog’s-eared, the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
account was pencilled on the pages he showed me. I
reproduce it verbatim, with its mistakes in spelling:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>It was on August 19th that our company set out from the
village of Couture. We crossed the fields to rejoin the Metz
road. After we had marched two kilometres along this road, we
took shelter in a wood in order to avoid being seen by a German
areoplane. After a short hault here, we started off once more
towards Fresne-en-Saulnois. We left this village on our left to
march upon Auron and Vivier. We found trenches made by the
enemy and some dead horses. In the evening we were before
Duron and Vivier, the Germans having left these two villages a
couple of hours earlier. We, the company “146,” occupied all
the exits from the villages. At about half past eight in the evening
the company shoulders knapsacks and we go to the outposts
before Frémery. We passed a fairly quiet night, a few shots
were fired towards midnight, and we thought there was a night
attack, but it was only a skirmish between patrols. Next day,
August 20th, at three in the morning the captain commands us to
extend in skirmishing order, for we had been warned that the
enemy is in front of us. In two or three leaps we reach the crest
of a little hill in front of us. At this moment we receive a few
bullets which oblige us to assume the ofensive. The lieutenant
orders us to fire at five hundred yards upon the enemy advancing
towards the crest. At this moment our comrade Arnold, the
cook, comes from the village of Frémery, the bombardment of
which has just begun, he held in his hands two pales of coffee
which he brings to his section, although the captain told him to
go back. But, he listening only to the commands of his own
courage and coolness, succeeds in joining his section which was
then engaged with the enemy. On reaching the line he began
to distribute the coffee, but hardly had he begun when he was
hit near the left eye not seriously, which stopped him for a
moment. But this did not hinder him from continuing his round,
stopping from time to time to fire his rifle. It was when he had
nearly reached the end of the line of skirmishers that he was hit
on the right rist. At this moment he was close to the sergeant-major,
who was lying at full length in a furrow and who with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
the aid of his soup spoon was digging a hole for his head; at
this moment we had no orders, for most of the non-coms and
privates had been killed or wounded.—The sub-lieutenant gives
the order to retire to those who are able, but the sergeant-major
stoped where he was saying to a man who was near him and
who was wounded. “No slackers here” giving him a blow with
the flat of his sword.—At this moment, the Germans make their
charge and come close up to us, the sergeant-major lifted his
arms into the air, crying, “quarter! my wife my child.”—A little
while after we were under the guard of some German soldiers,
who conducted us as best they could to the hospital at Lucy.
On the way the sergeant-major said to us that but for his spoon
he would perhaps be a dead man?</p>

</div>

<p>I was touched by this little story. Maze thinks only
of praising Arnold’s heroism. He says not a word
about his own wound, although this was severe. He
was struck in the neck, and the bullet is still beneath
the shoulder-blade. One day he stripped in my
presence and I felt the projectile. At the same time I
had a good view of the sun, the stars, and the nymphs
wherewith his chest is decorated, framing the great
portrait of Carpentier which Maze had had tattooed
while in Paris.</p>

<p>Speaking generally, the memoirs I have read have
lacked interest. The hero speaks of the beer he has
drunk, of the naps he has been able to snatch between
the attacks, gives the names of his sergeant, of his
comrades. We get absolutely no idea of the battle he
was in. I reproduce, however, the story of Marius-Eugène
G⸺, who was made prisoner on August 27th
at Moyen-Moutier. It is the best I have discovered in
the fort:</p>

by<br />
Marius-Eugène G⸺</i></p>

<p class="right"><i>Moyen-Moutier, August 27, 1914.</i></p>

<p>Am alone, have lost my regiment, my company, am at
Moyen-Moutier. Endeavour to join up with the 52nd or the
75th, can’t do it, stop and think, the firing begins again. The
Germans are bombarding the town. What on earth shall I do?
I lose my head, I am alone, I have no friend, no one to advise me.
I run like a madman; I stop when I hear the whistling of the
German projectiles I stretch myself at full length on the ground
they fall two hundred yards from me and then come nearer.
At length I give myself up for lost, I loose my head more and more
however I think much of Rive-de-Gier of my dear employers of
my dear love also of my brother and sister-in-law and of my
dear little niece in fact of every one dear to me and it is with
sorrow that I see the shells raning round me I ast myself if I
shall ever see again this dear family, this idol which I carry in
my heart. Having received a slight wound in the arm I went
to the red cross and I have made the acquaintance of a dear
friend of the 75th where we always remain brothers in misfortune
since the hour when we were made prisoner, Thursday
August 27 1914 at five o’clock in the evening; from there they
sent us to sleep in a school, without a straw, still get through
the night somehow and early next morning they make a list of
the prisoners and send us to Saale which is on the frontier
twenty kilometres from Moyen-Moutier, on the way the German
soldiers make a long stop and gives us a bit of food a meal
which I and my compatriots much enjoyed for we were getting
very hungry at length we reach Saale it is about five in the
evening, they make us sleep hard just like last night only
instead of a school it is a church which has been transformed
into a dormitory no great catch, the night is rather cold but we
get through it somehow. Saturday August 29 we entrain at
Saale station at nine o’clock in the morning without knowing
where we are going it was a day of anguish for me and also for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
all my friends in the same situation as myself, we remain all
day in the train all night and all Sunday August 30 when we
arrive at our destination Ingolstadt at eight o’clock in the evening,
they tells us that there is still 2 hours march to reach Fort
Orff where I am still in prison after 4 weeks.</p>

<p>September 24. The weather to-day is rather grey and cold
we stay in the rooms, tell what has hapened to us during the
campane and the poor fellows serving with the colours when
the war broke out said that this was the day of their discharge
however we did all that we could to enliven the dull life we
have had since our imprisonment.</p>

<p>Being quite without money to provide for my little wants, I am
sorry to say that I have had to sell the ring that belonged to my
dear mother the one she gave me the year before she died I
was forced to sell it to buy food for they do not give us enough
to eat and it is with regret that I sacrificed it in order to avoid
coming to a bad end, all this is due to this cursed war from
which I have been suffering for 2 months now, I hope it will
soon be over and that I shall be able to resume the life of peace
and happiness I led in the barracks where I had a happy time
during the week and on Sunday was happy to be able to get
leave to go to Rive-de-Gier where I passed such a pleasant day
with my dear employers and my dear girl and that dear family
of which I often think, at every moment of the day my thoughts
turn to them.</p>

<p>Now at length the day is finished and the moment has come
to go and fetch the wretched pittance which they give us as
food then to have some talk with my friend, companion in
misfortune, bedfellow for we sleep together on one heap of
straw and with one blanket, all this because of this cursed war,
still never mind the suffering, it is for France.</p>

<p>September 25. Glorious weather, one can feel the warmth of
the sun, I take advantage of it to get up quickly, to have a wash,
then I go to fetch the trickle of hot water they give us for
coffee, I profit by the opening of this fine autumn day to take a
turn or two about the fort to take my thoughts off and to proffit
by this fine sunshine which has been very rare since my
imprisonment in Bavaria.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, I do like many of the comrades my fellow-prisoners,
try to do some work upon Bavarian stone, to make a souvenir
of the fort, but I have no patience and chuck the thing away,
for it does not take my thoughts off?</p>

<p>Good biz! a friend in the room has a pack of cards and we
begin to play game after game of manilla, this turns our thoughts
a bit but its not as good as the old games we used to play in
the taverns of the old Couzonnais quarter. In spite of all I
think of everyone I left behind me in that old town, of my dear
employers, of their old parents who was so good to me and
also of the dear parents of my dear girl who is never out of my
thoughts and who I hope she thinks much of me.</p>

<p>Thursday, October 1st. Having been one day without writing
I hasten to quickly write these two words, these moments are
so sweet for me besides to write one is obliged to be alone and
that is why to-day finding myself at the top of the fort where I
look over all the plane and at the end of it the fine town of
Ingolstadt I see many factory chimnies which are smoking
also the fields where some Bavarian peasants is working in this
place one would never think, seeing the sight which is spread
beneath my eyes, one would never think that canon are
thundering a few(?) kilometres away. All that I have written
on this page makes me feel sick at heart for outside this cursed
fort there would be liberty and peace for always. For such a
life as we have been living, everyone of us here, is not to be
envied. After a war like that we are going through, just as
much for the german people as for the French, there is ruin
for the 2 countries where are killed or wounded numerous
fathers of families who leaves a wife without support with one
or more children! I have not yet the rite to be mourned like
these fathers of families, but in spite of everything I think much
of my life in the future when I hope to be able to make the girl
I love happy and whom I hope will not desert me even though
she gets no news of me. Here then is the month of October
begining very sadly I live in hope that the end will be a
little better.</p>

</div>

<p>There, it is not very grand, but it is so sincere, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
in any case this work of the pen makes the time pass
less heavily. Poetizing, music, memoirs, tobogganing,
little dinners, German, cards, whittling, stone-carving—some
of the prisoners find the days too short. What an
odd creature is man!</p>

<p>Tesson came to see me just now, bringing his last
piece of work, a great slab of stone depicting the
entrance to Fort Orff. The whole kitchen staff formed
up in circle round the masterpiece. “Well I’m blowed!”
said Devèse. “That’s not been done with the point of
a pickaxe,” remarked Deschênes by way of praise. I
also expressed my admiration. Then the master drew
from his pocket a book with clasps, cut in limestone.
He had carved on it the title: <i>Les Mémoires de Victor
Tesson, prisonnier de guerre, à sa méchante Louise Huber.—Dolomieu,
Isère.</i> While I was praising the dedication,
he showed me his tools, saying: “Here are my
cold chisel and my piercer. I made them out of my
bicycle pliers. Here’s my ruler; I ‘forged’ it out of
the tyre of a wheelbarrow.”—“Is that all?”—“That’s
all. I have no dividers; I measure with a straw.”</p>

<p>Unquestionably the Frenchman is a very live animal.
When I hear my fellow-prisoners applauding the artistes
of No. 7, Lannessan, Grignon, Saint-Lanne, Bouquet,
or the “artistes socialistes” of No. 38, the members of
the audience splitting their sides with laughter at the
satirical allusions and joining lustily in the choruses;
when I go to No. 13 to visit Le Second, who receives
me with the affected airs of a dandy as he ushers me
into his domain of five feet square, incredibly elegant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
and quaint, fitted up à la Martine; when I contemplate
the roguish gaiety of all these “Gavroches,” their indefatigable
activity, the effervescence of their wit—I think
of a Swiss friend of mine who is always saying, “These
devils of Frenchmen!” I can even understand the
stupefaction of that great barrel of a Max! One will
never get the better of these fellows. One will never
bend such bodies beneath the yoke of servitude. Without
violence, by the simple play of their natural life,
they would tame the most mulish of masters. The
substance of which they are composed, ever radiating
energy, is irreducible. It is evident that, by special
privilege, they are born “free men.” Sovereign
people!</p>

<p>How right is Péguy when he says that their watchword
is “Hope.” Misfortune befalls them; they seem
overwhelmed. From disorganization they pass to
grumbling and from grumbling to revolution. Come
back to look at them to-morrow; you will find them
valiant, dashing, light-hearted heroes recking no longer
of yesterday. They laugh at their sufferings. They
sing. They defy their gollywogs of gaolers. They
combine to think out some new plan. They engage
in some fresh piece of work. Merely to look at them
renews the savour of life.</p>

<p>At first everything went amiss here. Apart from
eating our starvation rations, we had nothing to do.
It was a terrible time. But contemplate them now;
they are blithe enough. They are prisoners, and yet
you would say they were in their own homes, masters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
owners. Prisoners? They seem to be the guardians
of their sentries; they go so far as to chide the sentries
if these are slovenly in the performance of their duties.
It is not that the prisoners have adapted themselves to
the environment, but that they have forced the environment,
willy nilly, to adapt itself to them. Like certain
mosses which grow where there is no humus, they catch
flying grains of dust and force these to yield the scanty
soil which will enable them to live.</p>

<p>Moreover, events seem to favour this natural propensity
to hope.</p>

<p class="tb">The last thing was your card with a picture of the
<i>Victory of Samothrace</i>. You had erased the title and
put a date in its place. Every one came to see this
bulletin of victory which I had put up beside your
portrait! I wish you could have heard the comments.</p>

<p>“Then we shall not have suffered for nothing,” said
a lad from Montmédy. “I was two days in the forest
with five comrades. We made holes in the trees to
suck the sap. We had hallucinations. Two of them
killed themselves.” Louis Ludes, a baker from
Pouzolles, wounded in Morocco, and wounded again
at Lunéville, the worst of wounds, a shell in the
abdomen (his recovery astonished all the surgeons),
exclaimed: “I too, tonnerre, I am in this victory!”</p>

<p>And while they were looking at the beautiful Greek
with the mighty wings, Dutrex, who was reading the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
<i>Burgraves</i>, declaimed to us in his grating bass voice,
full of cruel irony, the mendicant’s apostrophe:</p>

<p>Half awake, I stretch out my hand to see whether
Dutrex is there. His palliasse is deserted, his rug folded
up. I raise myself on my elbow. All the others are still
asleep, lying like long mute mummies. I draw on my
shoes. At the main entrance, the sentries, hands in
pockets, heads between their shoulders, are stamping
their feet, their eyes white with cold. “<i>Guten Morgen!</i>”—“<i>Guten
Morgen!</i>” I grope my way down the stair
and along the passage. The lamps have gone out.
There is a light in No. 22. I go in. Dutrex is
shaving; his little mirror is perched on the vice. In
front of him stands a smoky lamp. All around is
darkness. Bouquet passes from one cauldron to
another, singing softly and sentimentally:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>The kitchen is full of sulphurous fumes. “What
time is it?”—“Five o’clock.” Dutrex has finished
shaving. I take his place before the mirror and the
lamp with the broken chimney. Some one knocks at the
door. A little man comes in. He wears a fatigue-cap;
his head is bowed, his face is tied up in a
handkerchief, he holds his left cheek with both hands.
He looks at us like a whipped dog. “I’m in such
pain!”—“What’s the matter?” asks Bouquet, who is
tender-hearted. The poor fellow is unable to speak
plainly. “I have been walking up and down the
corridors for a long time. I can’t keep still. My
wound is gnawing at me. It seems to be screaming
there, just under the ear!”—“Poor chap, you must see
Laloux, but he is still asleep. Sit down there between
the stoves. There’s a stool for you. Drink a mug of
coffee while you’re waiting. That’ll warm you.”—“Yes,
I’m perished with cold.”</p>

<p>Instead of a cheek he has a great violet crevasse with
lines of scar tissue radiating from it. He was struck by
a bullet which passed in obliquely through the nose and
on its way out shattered half the left side of the face,
including the articulation of the jaw. He has an abscess
forming in the internal ear, which is pretty sure to kill
him. While I shave, I look at this reservist.</p>

<p>He arrived with the last batch of convalescent
wounded. Most of them were but half cured. They
were sent away from Ingolstadt to make room for
refugees from Pomerania, children, women, and old
men, broken down through privation. The Russian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
wave is washing these refugees by thousands into the
southern hutments.</p>

<p>“Does it still hurt?”</p>

<p>“Not quite so much.”</p>

<p>“Where are you from?”</p>

<p>“From a village near Mans.”</p>

<p>“Do you think that your missus will be able to love
you with that hole in your cheek and your hanging
jaw?”</p>

<p>“I hope so.”</p>

<p>“Where were you in barracks?”</p>

<p>“At Saint-Mihiel.”</p>

<p>“Where did you get your wound?”</p>

<p>“At Marville, near Virton, in Belgium.”</p>

<p>“Long ago?”</p>

<p>“August 24th.”</p>

<p>“Here’s another mug of coffee for you.”</p>

<p>The man, Vouvard by name, puts his hand behind
the ear, closes his eyes, and rocks to and fro, saying:
“I don’t know what to do, it hurts so.”</p>

<p>The cooks come in. With great hooks they take
down the boiling cauldrons. Dutrex goes out for the
roll-call. Steam fills the casemate, stifling us, and I open
the window. Day is breaking; tiny clouds of a pale
silver tint are floating at a great altitude. Deschênes,
the woodman from the forest of Argonne, catching sight
of the white frost on the slope, says with conviction:
“This sort of weather gives one the hump here. Think
how jolly it would be to be at work. Think how there
are people perishing of hunger while we are shut up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
here doing nothing. And when we get home we shall
have to work ourselves to death to pay off the debts our
wives have made while we have been away. A lot of
good one gets out of war!”</p>

<p>Dutrex enters with a martial stride. “I say, Riou,
here are the latest orders from headquarters: ‘The
purveyors and the workmen employed at the fort must
be accompanied by a soldier of the guard; the prisoners
are forbidden to approach them. The sale of food and
drink to prisoners is strictly forbidden. The commandants
are responsible for seeing that these orders
are carried out.’”</p>

<p>“Very well, the slopes are also forbidden. I will
immediately go for a walk there.”</p>

<p>I linger on the ramparts. The sun is about to
rise. The air is pure, like that of the high mountains.
Beyond the huge Danubian plain I catch sight for the
first time of the blue serrations of the Tyrolese Alps,
crowning the delicate lines of the middle distance.
To-day is the feast of the Immaculate Conception.
The air is filled with the sound of bells. The deep
notes of those of Ingolstadt mingle with the brighter
chimes of Hepperg, Wegstetten, and Lenting. The
cocks are crowing. The crows are flying at a great
height, and the harmonious silence is broken from time
to time by their croakings. Everything glistens. The
sky is superb. The earth rejoices. The soul finds
refreshment and delight in the elysian dawn.</p>

<p>Over there, towards the rising sun, upon the Warthe
and in the Carpathian defiles, men are killing one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
another. In the opposite quarter, beyond the gentle
undulations dotted with white farms and beyond the
magnificent barrier of the Swabian Jura, men are killing
one another in Alsace, in Lorraine, and in Flanders.
The villages of Europe are filled with truncated limbs,
wooden legs, broken lives. Poor world of men!</p>

<h2 id="HE_GOES_AWAY">HE GOES AWAY</h2>

<p class="right"><i>December 13, 1914.</i></p>

<p>He leaves this evening. Every one is sad. Who will
replace him? If only it is not a man belonging to the
school of the <i>Münchener Neueste Nachrichten</i>,<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> which
has been summoning the government to take reprisals
against the French prisoners. “<i>Geduld genug!</i>” exclaimed
the official journalist; “We have been patient
long enough!” He demanded the head of Colonel
Grey, Sir Edward Grey’s brother, and also that of
Delcassé’s son, both of whom had been wounded and
taken prisoner. The <i>Ingolstädter Zeitung</i> has been
even more drastic than the Munich journal.</p>

<p>Yesterday passed gloomily. The men of the guard,
like all those who have not been at the front, were
spiteful and meddlesome. The patrol refused to allow
us to set foot upon the slopes, even insisting that
we must remain in the mud and puddles of the lower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
courts. Brissot and I contended that they did not
know the regulations, and that the great track half-way
up which dominates the two courts was certainly within
bounds. Anyhow, taking advantage of the mist, I had
before sunrise walked as usual on the forbidden escarp.
Then, having a slight cold, and feeling poorly, I
lay down upon a pile of palliasses in the Salle du
Jeu de Paume, and spent the day in re-reading <i>Eugénie
Grandet</i>, which Corporal Henriot had just received from
Paris.</p>

<p>But I was thinking more about the baron’s departure
than about old Grandet. The others were playing chess.
“What a fine chap he is!” exclaimed Détry. “Riou,
old boy, we ought to make him a grand speech when he
leaves. Did you see the farewell note he sent round
the casemates? He thanks his ‘fellow-workers.’ He
courteously congratulates every one. He wishes us
good luck. There’s a man for you, one who has never
failed to treat us as men. Nothing of the Ploss about
him!”</p>

<p class="tb">Lying with my head beneath the rug, my book closed,
and my eyes shut, it suddenly seemed to me that the
recent weeks had been almost enjoyable. I forgot the
long nights of the first month or so, when my stomach
was continually gnawing, and when the memories of
meals eaten before the war, their steam, their odour,
were so vivid as to constitute a veritable torture of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
Tantalus. Forgetting home-sickness and tedium, I
found myself looking back wistfully to that which in
actual experience had appeared horrible.</p>

<p>It seemed to me that with the transfer of von Stengel
a fresh imprisonment was about to begin, harassing, with
no security, and inhuman; that henceforward I should
be truly in prison.</p>

<p>An end, I said to myself, to our evening walks on
the roads adjoining the fort. An end to those pleasant
saunters in the twilight, a little band of five or six,
almost as good as a tête-à-tête after the life of the herd.
Our new master, just married, will devote his leisure to
his wife. Possibly, moreover, as the baron has suggested,
the recent escape of four English officers from Fort
Hartmann will make the new commandant very
strict.…</p>

<p>All at once it was borne in on me that the last few
weeks had been at the same time melancholy and
pleasing.…</p>

<p class="tb">Farewell to my hop-garden, in which I had gleaned
dried hops wherewith to spice the insipid German
tobacco. Farewell to my bushes of blackthorn and
barberry, where I plucked red berries, where I cut such
fine switches—<i>der Stock des Gelehrten</i>, as Stengel said.
Farewell to my farm at Hepperg, my great country
seat which has fallen to the female line, whose fortress-like
walls, amid the straw stacks and the noisy populace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
of ganders, geese, hens, and guinea-fowl, spoke to me of
my birthplace grieving for the two sons at the war, spoke
to me of the country house haloed in memories, dozing
beneath the winter sun in the light shade of the olives
and the sad cypresses, blue-girdled by the shining hills
of Vivarais. Farewell to the disused quarry, the silent
undergrowth, filled with shafts of light and with
gossamer; the carpet of dead leaves white with hoar-frost,
which crackles beneath the feet. Farewell to my
royal Danubian plain, where the setting sun throws into
relief the huge and gentle undulations, dotted with
smoking villages. Farewell to my evening skies, my
grand Bavarian twilights, infinitely variable, which will
remain the most splendid memory of my imprisonment.</p>

<p class="tb">I was above all grateful to Baron von Stengel for
having asked me to join him in his afternoon walks with
the French medical officers. As you know, I have more
taste for the beauties of nature than for the doings of
my kind. In thus presenting me with the freedom of
the fields, my gaoler gave me the thing I like best in
the world, barring your company and that of a few
intimates.</p>

<p>He extended me this invitation one morning when I
was in the throes of despondency. It was late in
September. At dawn there had been an iridescent
haze. On the escarp, great drops of water had
formed on the birch and willow branches, and were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
falling thence to the ground. The weather was
splendid; the sun was gradually dispersing the transparent
vapours; and yet one could imagine that all
nature was weeping. I was tired out. To secure
oblivion, I had been working too assiduously for several
days. I was at the end of my resources; the sordidness
of the surroundings sickened me and hunger gnawed at
my vitals. I was unutterably miserable. I had no
strength to do anything but to yearn for you, to dream
of flowers, of fresh springs, space, freedom. France!
France! Brissot, hoping to cure me, had brought me
George Sand’s <i>Maîtres sonneurs</i>, a greasy volume which
had found its way here God knows how, perhaps stolen
from the municipal school by a soldier quartered in the
fort. Said Brissot: “It is redolent of nature; I am
bringing you the very bouquet of the French countryside!”
Such was my condition when the major came
by. “Hallo, monsieur Riou,” he exclaimed, “you don’t
look as cheerful as usual.”—“I’m home-sick, mon commandant.”—“Would
you care to take a walk with me
in the country this evening?”—“Should I care to!”</p>

<p>My memory of this first excursion is of a joy which
was perfect though uneventful. The great black gate
with its heraldic lions was opened by the sentry for the
egress of the major and his companions; to the left lay
the avenue, the thicket of acacias masking the ditch
of retreat; below us, between the shivering, gold-capped
birches, the gentle and unending undulations of the
plain; to the right, seen obliquely, the yellow out-buildings,
the tall hop-poles, the military road cut up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
by artillery fire, running straight in the direction of
the sombre crest of the Franconian Jura, and crossing
the huge chessboard of ploughed fields; further on, the
little strategic wood, a magnificent growth of fir-trees,
larches, and beeches, encircled by stone-pines and oaks,
a sort of sacred grove, with an undergrowth of the most
varied nature.</p>

<p>I was walking in the rear of our little company, going
quietly along, avoiding conversation, filled with delight.</p>

<p>“Are you still sad, M. Riou?” said the baron.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, I am perfectly happy.”</p>

<p>The wide sky covering the wide landscape; the
delicate lines of the horizon; the purity of the light;
the brilliancy of the September tints; the fragrance of
the fields; the herds of oxen; the ploughs at work,
guided by boys whistling melancholy airs—it was a
Virgilian scene. Poor wreckage from the battles of
Lorraine that I was, this energy of nature, of peaceful
and robust nature, flooded my heart with great waves
of mute pleasure far more intense than the intoxication
of the senses. After the blood-stained fields of Dieuze,
after the fetid prison-house, after qualms, suffocation,
base and monotonous wretchedness, it seemed to me
that I was coming back to life.</p>

<p>The wood was swarming with mushrooms. My
companions, especially Lœbre, were mycologists. They
scattered among the undergrowth. “Here’s a real nest
of <i>tricholoma personatum</i>,” cried Bouvat in sonorous
tones. “Come and make sure, Lœbre.” Lœbre
saunters up. The young man smiles good-naturedly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
“Pooh! that’s not the lilac stem! That’s <i>amanita
muscaria</i>. That’s no good to us. But you have overlooked
those fine <i>russulæ</i> behind you on the roots of
the pine-trees.” “Herr Lœbre, here’s a prize!” called
out M. Cavaillé, in Languedoc German. “Here are
some <i>lactarii deliciosi</i>; come and look, a regular fairy-ring
of them.” Their mouths watering, they all crowd
round this epicure’s fare. “What a feast we shall have
this evening!” Now comes Jeandidier, of Longwy in
Lorraine, walking up with long, deliberate strides,
carrying very carefully, as a man carries a candle in
a procession, beneath his fiery beard and his long
Bavarian pipe, two great parasol mushrooms, which
of all the mushrooms have the longest stems, have the
most delicate flavour, and are the most fragile. Bouvat
bore away the spoils. Each one made his contribution
of <i>russula cyanoxantha</i>, <i>clitocybe</i>, meadow agaric, and
liver fungus. The baron was amused by these schoolboy
antics. From time to time a covey of partridges was
put up, and flew noisily away; or a hare, awakened
with a start, fled in terror. Night was falling. We
made our way back, skirting the glacis. I culled a
bouquet of autumn leaves. We crossed a field from
which the potatoes had just been lifted. A few of the
tubers had been overlooked. I put them in my pocket
with great care, under the baron’s very eyes. Bouquet,
the head cook, made a fry of them that evening. Eight
of us enjoyed them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>This morning a deputation of the comrades came to
me when I was at work, to commission me to write a
farewell address. It had to be very short, since the
baron could spare us but a few minutes. In pencil
(ink is forbidden) I quickly compose what is needed.
I read it to the deputation, which approves the wording.
I give a hasty polish to my shoes, and we set out for
the <i>Kommandantur</i>. The baron shakes hands. We
arrange ourselves in a semicircle. I am at the right
wing, close to the commandant. His successor is there,
a stiff-mannered little man, quite inscrutable. He wears
a yager’s cap, green in colour, pulled down to the ears;
the collar of his tunic stands up so as almost to hide his
head, but we can see his drooping features and cold
eyes. While I am speaking he stands at attention.</p>

<p>“Mon commandant, to every one of us your departure
is a matter of personal regret. You are an enemy, but
never has any one had a more courteous enemy.</p>

<p>“You have treated us as soldiers, with perfect frankness;
we have treated you as the true gentleman that
you are.</p>

<p>“We, the French prisoners at Fort Orff, differ upon
many points. But there is one matter upon which,
when we return to France, we shall all agree, namely,
that Commandant Major Baron von Stengel deserved
and gained the affection and admiration of those
towards whom for three months he had to fill the
position of gaoler.</p>

<p>“Accept our thanks, mon commandant. God have
you in his keeping.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>With moist eyes, M. von Stengel introduces us to
his successor, each one by name, detailing our qualities,
our services, the incidents of our career. Stiff as ever,
the <i>Oberleutnant</i> bows to each in turn, to the infantry of
the line, to the chasseurs à pied, to the chasseurs alpins,
to the artillery, to the engineers, to the hussars. They
are tall, handsome fellows, of the same type as the
grand old von Stengel. We can hardly believe that
we are in Germany. We are sincerely affected, quite
free from self-consciousness. The baron speaks to us
as friends. At his age, when the events that one can
look forward to are numbered, everything seems of
importance. This separation is painful to him. None
of us can fail to recognize it; there is no pretence about
his distress. He presses us by the hand. He tells me
that he will have our address translated, and that he is
going to send on his carriage with the luggage. “I
want to take a last walk with my friends,” he said.
“God guard you, my fine fellows.”</p>

<p>The walk, just now, was a melancholy affair. To
avoid the mud on the road we strolled along the edge
of the fields towards Hepperg, crowding round the
baron as round a dear friend who is taking leave for
ever. Great bands of red striated the dark sky.
Smokelike vapours lowered over the earth. Night came
on, gloomy and solemn. The baron spoke to me of
Ingolstadt, whose massive steeples could be seen in
the distance through the mist rising from the Danube.
He told me that apart from Germelsheim in the
Palatinate, this was the only fortress in Bavaria; that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
Tilly and Wallenstein had lived there; that the little
town of twenty thousand inhabitants had been a capital
in its day. When we reached the gate, he said with
a smile, “I count my friends’ heads; all of them are
here.” We shook hands lingeringly and in silence at
the door of the <i>Kommandantur</i>.</p>

<p>Farewell now to the fields; farewell, even, to the
footpath of the escarp. I have been warned that I
shall be fired on if I am seen there. I must be content
henceforward with the muddy track overlooking the
poor amphitheatre of the courts, filthier than a pigsty.
I still have your little acacias, leafless, lugubrious,
shivering in the bitter wind.</p>

<p>Our new gaoler has introduced a fresh method of
taking the roll-call. We have all to line up in two
ranks in the sticky mud of the ditches, and to wait
there while we are counted. This ridiculous enumeration
interferes with the digestion of our poor midday
meal, and serves more than any other petty formality
to remind us that we are prisoners. Just now, when
the gloomy ceremony was finished, I went to see the
<i>Feldwebel</i>.</p>

<p>He is a wealthy horse-dealer from Ratisbon, cunning,
short, with a receding forehead, fresh-coloured, laughing
eyes, well padded with fat, a typical German Jew.
Recently emerged from poverty, moderately patriotic,
secretly thinking that people are very stupid to get
their skins perforated for the <i>Vaterland</i> and other fine
words, he takes for his own motto in all circumstances
that a living dog is better than a dead lion. He has
managed to arrange that his part in the campaign
shall be a safe one, played where he will be close to
his faithful spouse and to his business, far from the
deadly bullets. He is quite a good fellow, with no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
desire to play the persecutor; but since his chief
dread is to be caught in a dereliction of duty and
sent to the front, he is extremely strict. Twice a
day, at two and at seven, we exchange language
lessons. This does not merely secure me some new
words of German, but also from time to time I am
given a handful of nuts and two or three apples.</p>

<p>I hasten off to fetch my parcel. I imagine that it
contains something to eat—chocolate, sausage—and I
am hungry. The <i>Feldwebel</i> giggles like a child. He
takes the key of No. 72, the terrible casemate which
is as damp as a drain; and, flanked by d’Arnoult and
myself, he reaches the “parcels office” at the end of
the gloomy passage. I walk confidently, for I have
already, by clandestine methods, scrutinized your consignment,
and weighed it in my hand. It was compact,
as heavy as one could wish, and felt like a ten-pound
box of Menier chocolate. I was cocksure. Here we
are; we light the lantern. I lay the packet on the table.
Keenly expectant, I cut open the oilcloth wrapping.
Books! Montaigne, Voltaire. An indulgent glance
from the <i>Feldwebel</i> at this consignment. I take my
leave. Brissot awaits me at the turn of the stairs.
“Well?”—“Books, old chap.”—“Capital! The
smallest grain of millet would have suited you better!”</p>

<p>Not even a letter, a little smuggled letter! How
punctilious you are! Do you know that your letter
of November 2nd did not come to hand till yesterday,
having taken forty-four days to travel from Paris
to Fort Orff?</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="OH_DEAR">OH, DEAR!</h2>

<p class="right"><i>February 26, 1915.</i></p>

<p>The first warm, sunny day. The grey grass of last
autumn is showing in patches here and there through
the melting snow; it is slightly tinged with green.
The sky is blue. A huge cloud, white and shining,
rolls towards the north.</p>

<p>Why do I feel so lightsome this morning? Is it
possible that I am once more what I was before
the war?</p>

<p>If only the end were nearing, the end of the long
miseries of winter in the lousy, stinking, and chattering
casemate! If an end were nearing to the sterile
cackle, the disquisitions on strategy, the disputes, and
the lamentations, to all that a discontented crowd exhales,
through the empty hours, in the way of physical
boredom and of melancholy! Oh the gnawing ache of
these two months in an ant-hill encompassed by snow,
filth, and bitter winds! Two months of purgatory. I
know now that to live among men, nothing but
men, day by day and night by night, in intimate
contact, without activity, without solitude, without the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
company of women (that other solitude), is to live in
purgatory.</p>

<p>Take men who have nothing in common but the
flag. They differ in traditions, education, and temperament;
their habits of life are fixed. They are in the
full vigour of manhood. They are strong and spirited.
They are familiar with violence and struggle. Throw
these soldiers pell-mell into a cellar, where they
hunger and are cut off from news. Subject them to
meddlesome regulations. Compel them, in this
wretchedness, to live always in close proximity, and
far from everything which they have hitherto known
as life. Doubtless they will have their good hours.
At times, when their minds are filled with thoughts of
those they love and of their motherland, their words
and their silences will be no less pure and sweet than
is a long summer twilight. Or when some newspaper,
concealed in a parcel from France, has brought them
tidings of victory and wafted to them all the hope of
their free brothers, they will experience a sublime
unison of joy. But at other times.… No, I wish
to forget. After all, the heroes of the great epic are
but men. Why should we expect of them, during
months and months, a patience and a self-command
of which many men in good society, men esteemed
well-bred, are incapable when a caller stays too long?</p>

<p class="tb">Everything has changed since Baron von Stengel’s
departure. The new commandant, M. Schwappach,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
of the department of streams and forests, possesses
all the virtues of the German bureaucrat. He is
active, precise, orderly, meticulous. He has also the
infatuation of his caste, for he believes that the world
gravitates round it. He admires and fears his chiefs,
and he applies to the very letter every <i>Befehl</i> from
headquarters. Everything is now forbidden. Daily
the <i>Feldwebel</i> reads the orders to the sentries: the
slopes are forbidden; without challenge, they must fire
upon any one who is seen there.</p>

<p class="tb">I have suffered greatly at being thus cut off from
the view to be obtained from the ramparts, and
this has affected me hardly less than the short
commons. The number of sentries has been tripled.
We are forbidden to wear civilian clothing unless it
has been dyed red. Headquarters has even compelled
the chasseurs alpins and the colonial infantrymen to
paint red stripes on their uniforms under the pretext
that these were too much like civilian clothing. It
has become impossible to get the most trifling supplement
to the official rations. M. Schwappach had a
<i>Landwehrmann</i> court-martialled because he had sold
some chocolate to the prisoners. The guard is terrorized.
The loaf which used to last three days must
now last five, so that our daily allowance of bread
is 7½ oz. This would mean sheer starvation if we
received nothing from France. No more coffee, no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
more roasted barley: roasted acorns merely. Those
who get more parcels than the others have a regular
train of dependents—famished men. My own dependents
are chiefly soldiers from the invaded regions.</p>

<p>Having written a strongly worded letter which was
sent back to me from Ingolstadt (I am in extremely
bad odour at headquarters), I am threatened, should
the offence be repeated, with being completely deprived
of the right to receive or send letters. I have already
been punished with three weeks of this measure.</p>

<p>I have had some very remarkable discussions with
the commandant. These people want us to love them.
They demand, filled with indignation, our reasons for
not loving them. If we give them our reasons in plain
terms, and support our assertions with facts and dates,
lo! ten days’ prison, on bread and water!</p>

<p>M. von Stengel, where are you? Anyhow, we now
know what German discipline is. We know it in all
its purity and all its splendour. There is no longer
any one to temper its severities.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="THE_RUSSIANS">THE RUSSIANS</h2>

<p class="right"><i>April 20, 1915.</i></p>

<p>The Russians whom we were dreading have arrived.
For the last three months the Germans have been
threatening us with them as with the plague, adding:
“In the camps where the French and the Russians are
together they always come to blows.”</p>

<p>One morning the <i>Oberstabsarzt</i> inoculated us against
cholera. Every one said: “They are coming!” The
<i>Feldwebel</i> did in fact go through the casemates, allotting
five to one, ten to another, and fifteen to some. In the
afternoon, groups were watching from the outer part of
the slope which commands the road from Ingolstadt.
There was much grumbling. Some were cursing the
Germans for wishing to poison us with the deadly
Asiatic disease. Some, frightened by the inoculation,
were already imagining themselves black and rotten.</p>

<p>At six in the evening, an hour earlier than usual,
the electric bell rang for the evacuation of the courts.
Immediately afterwards, the forty-nine heads of rooms
were summoned, were drawn up in line beyond the
bridge, and were told to wait.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>The gentle April twilight had already enveloped the
brow of the slopes, and the lower red-brick front looking
into the ditch lay hidden in the gathering darkness as
if in ambuscade. French prisoners were bunched round
the windows. With laughing faces they defied the
commandant, stiff and dapper, doing sentry-go on
the glacis. Under his very nose they began to hum
the Russian national anthem. But the Russians
did not come. The great black gate, buttressed between
the mossy walls of the counterscarp, starred
with anemone and colt’s-foot, remained obstinately
shut. Impatience grew. At length the outer sentry
whistled, the <i>Hauptmann</i> went forward, and the gate
opened.</p>

<p>The distribution of the convoy was effected in
the Prussian manner. Each headman went to take
delivery of his Russians outside, behind the gate, and
conducted the supplementary squad to his casemate.
This took half an hour. In Indian file, following their
French corporal or sergeant, they went along at a quick
step, but noiselessly in their supple jack-boots; they
were muffled in huge grey overcoats, and their size
was increased by enormous fur caps. Night fell. The
dead colour of their uniforms melted away in the darkness.
The silence was absolute. Pale Scythian faces,
flat-nosed Tartar faces, Asiatic types with wide cheek-bones,
Samoyede beards, downy and curled—all the
Russias were passing. We looked on. When they
had crossed the bridge the fort swallowed them.</p>

<p>In the interior, to the scandal of our masters, French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
rule prevailed. Notwithstanding the order confining
us to our rooms, the “Frantsuz” crowded to the
thresholds to greet the “little fathers”—“Good-day,
Russkis!” they cried, regardless of the Boches; “<i>Germania
kaput!</i> The Carpathians floup!” They made
roguish gestures indicating freedom.</p>

<p>“What monkeys!” thought the Germans, as they
looked on. The truth is that no one understands so
well as the French how to invent a language, to supplement
words by signs and onomatopœias. They have
an excellent excuse for neglecting the study of foreign
languages! Does a good mime learn foreign tongues?</p>

<p>The Russians got on little faster in the corridors of
Fort Orff than in the attack upon Lowicz, where their
advance was obstructed by barbed wire. Each door
was an ambush; every Frenchman an obstacle. Cigars
and cakes rained upon them. And then the handshakings
and the amicable clappings on the shoulder.
Détry, though he is as much afraid of lice as of cholera,
exchanged his képi for an imposing Siberian headdress
made of sheepskin, bristling, stinking, and
alive!</p>

<p>The little fathers had had nothing to eat since the
previous day. The quartermaster served them out a
morsel of cheese, but no bread. “<i>Germania, niet hleb</i>”
(“There is no bread in Germany!”), said the Russians,
“<i>Ja, nichts Brot!</i>” rejoined the French in their bad
German; “but France <i>Brot</i>, plenty <i>Brot</i>!” Thus
communicating with their friends in nigger talk, they
emptied their haversacks before the hungry men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>The Germans laughed on the wrong side of their
mouths. They had expected war; what they saw
was love. Until nine o’clock the turmoil was incredible.
Each room was treating its new recruits.
The poorer rooms offered crusts of white bread baked
in Saintonge or Lower Brittany. In the well-to-do
quarters the men brewed chocolate and served it with
rusks. Since in my room, that of the interpreters,
there were no Russians, I went to No. 16, the casemate
of Corporal Dumoulin, my comrade-at-arms.
Dinner was finished. Seated on their palliasses doubled
over, our allies were digesting the good things sent by
French mothers. Near the window, a hairdresser was
already dealing with the great mops of hair.</p>

<p>“You see,” said Dumoulin, “I want to smarten them
up. But how pious and ceremonious they are. Of
course we divided our food with them. They all
kissed my hand. Then they took off their caps, said
their prayers, and fed. After that, they got up, said
their prayers again, and kissed my hand once more.
But what have you got there?”</p>

<p>“I have no Russians, so I shall adopt yours. But
unfortunately they have already dined!”</p>

<p>“Don’t bother about that; they will dine ten times
over this evening!”</p>

<p>It was my turn to be embraced. Gingerbread,
Easter eggs, jam, petit-beurre biscuits, dates, cigarettes—I
was kissed between each course. One of the
Russians, a hairy corporal, a thick-set man, with dog-like
eyes, was not satisfied with my hand, but kissed me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
on the lips. I suppose it is the custom of the country.
Some of them overwhelmed me with profound genuflexions
as if I had been the white elephant.</p>

<p>Throughout the evening there was an intoxication of
generosity. Thrifty men at ordinary times, the French
now gave all they had. Il Poverello could not have done
better. The huge round loaves kneaded in the family
kneading-trough and baked in the village oven, the
apples and nuts of the last harvest, old sausages spiced
with garlic and thyme, everything, even the “surprises”
secretly prepared by the maman for her boy in captivity—everything
was handed over. Little Stéphanus
of Saint-Denis, who has lost his hearing through a
wound in the head, and who, being an orphan, would
receive nothing from France were it not for you and
Mme. Weiss, had only his fifth of a loaf of potato bread.
He gave it. The comrades from the invaded regions,
who have to live on the provisions of their “adopted
brothers,” were greatly distressed that they had nothing
to share out but their poverty.</p>

<p>But if charity was lively, gaiety was insane. The
little fathers were stupefied with astonishment. They
looked upon us as legendary <i>bariny</i> (seigneurs), as
Crœsuses flowing with milk and honey, as magicians
proof against misfortune, able to make the desert, and
even the prison pavement, blossom like the rose. What
a change for them! They had been the serfs of the
Boche sergeants in the Lechfeld camp, their backs were
still smarting from the canings administered to revenge
the loss of Przemysl, and from this they were suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
transported to become guests at the feast of the
parable! Rich and poor, beggars and lords, all were
equal, all were friends, all were brothers at this primitive
Christian agape, which lacked nothing, not even good
cigars. Such plenty and such brotherhood turned their
heads. Bewildered and mute, ignorant of our language
as we were ignorant of theirs, and having no other
means of showing us their gratitude, they kissed us
in season and out, and they prostrated themselves
before us as before their own icons.</p>

<p>I have spoken to you about Graby, one of the
two famous comic cyclists known in Paris, and indeed
throughout Europe, under the name of the Brothers
Abbins. His wound is healed. He is as lithe as
ever, gay, martial, a jolly fellow. “<i>Ein lustiger Gesell</i>,”
the <i>Feldwebel</i> calls him, adding, “There’s a typical
Frenchman for you!” In Dumoulin’s room I am
being melted almost to tears under the Russian kisses,
when Graby bursts open the door, and, quite out of
breath, exclaims: “Riou, old chap, my Slav poilus
are making ready to dance. I invite you to the
party.” He drags me off. His casemate is at the
other end of the fort. On the way he explains that
he has discovered a sort of interpreter, a Pole who has
been in New York, and who knows a few words of
English. “You’ll see, we’re going to have high jinks
to-night!”</p>

<p>There are indeed high jinks. An assemblage of
képis and fur caps beneath a huge candelabra, improvised
by the hosts, and ornamented with aeroplanes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
and flags cut out of paper. A horrible menagerie
odour fills the room. The banquet is over. Tea is
being handed round in old tins. Graby, looking even
more like a street arab than usual, is doing the honours,
assisted by big Ménard, erect, smart, as clean shaven
as a British guardsman, and with the suspicion of an
English accent. Prompted by Abbins, the Pole introduces
me as a French writer familiar with Russian
authors.</p>

<p>“Friends!”</p>

<p>“Friends!”</p>

<p>“Comrades!”</p>

<p>“<i>Sayousniki!</i>”</p>

<p>“Bravo!”</p>

<p>“Hurrah!”</p>

<p>“Now,” says Graby, sketching a figure, “let us
dance.”</p>

<p>A circle is formed. Two youths as lean as cats
confront one another. At first they make a feint of
sparring. They seem as if engaged in a slow and
weary pyrrhic dance. The onlookers’ eyes sparkle;
an indefinite measure is beaten with the hands. This
lasts for two minutes. Then the rhythm becomes
brisker, the partners draw themselves up to their full
height and keep their arms closely pressed to their
sides; they are motionless like fakirs. But with their
heels they make a noise which sounds like that of
distant castanets, a muted crackling in an ever-accelerating
tempo. A sudden pause. The dancers
squat on their hams. There follows the famous step<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
which we have beheld at the Russian ballet, the
strange dance whose savage rhythm is punctuated
by the clacking of boots on the boards. At the very
end, the Russians give an abrupt “Hurrah!” It is over.
Graby congratulates his men by patting their cheeks,
by commendatory gurgles, by the “boo, boo, boo,”
and other labial interjections that mothers use to their
nurslings.</p>

<p>More tea, more cigarettes. We ask for the Russian
national anthem. You know it. It seems to me as
heavy as a convict’s fetters. To relieve my ears I
demand the <i>Marseillaise</i>. Boude sings the couplets and
we take up the chorus. The swing of it, the decision,
the thrill, as of a victorious charge, astonish the Russians.
My neighbour the Pole weeps.</p>

<p>“You are crying?” I say to him in English.</p>

<p>“You can’t understand,” he makes answer. “That
air represents liberty. You possess it; you don’t know
the value of it. We dream of it.” His debased English
was interspersed with Polish phrases which rang with
a sort of Latin sweetness. “Don’t you know that we
are slaves?”</p>

<p>“This war will free you.”</p>

<p>“You think so? We have fought well enough! My
comrades stood firm when they were being mown down
before Lowicz. Yes, we have fought fiercely for the
Czar, even while feeling that his victory would serve
only to make our chains heavier. Poor Poland! Poor
Poland!”</p>

<p>The name of Poland attracts the attention of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
big artilleryman with a bull neck, a flat nose, a hard
and suspicious expression.</p>

<p>“What are you saying about Poland?” he asks me
in German.</p>

<p>“That this war will liberate the country. You have
the Czar’s promise.”</p>

<p class="tb">His fixed look, fierce and defiant, his turned-up
chin, his tanned and robust visage, contrast with
the noble passion of his words. Never before have I
witnessed real despair, that despair which hardens the
features and vulcanizes the soul, despair transformed
into a motive for living.</p>

<p>This Pole is as tragic as one of Wyspianski’s
heroes.</p>

<p>Around us the others are enjoying themselves
like brothers reunited. Graby is begging Ménard
to sing the American <i>Row! Row! Row!</i> I long
to take my companion out on to the slopes, and
there, amid the silence, to let him talk at length, to
listen, and to make him feel that I share his dreams,
that France is the friend of every nation that yearns
for freedom.</p>

<p class="tb">The Pole makes no accusations against France. She
has deceived his people, but he loves her just the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
same. He believes in her, despite her faults, as the
great champion of justice.</p>

<p>Ménard is singing. The French and the Russians
are taking up in chorus the refrain, “Row! Row!
Row!” Elbows on knees, head in hands, expression disdainful,
my Pole says no more, but sits like a colossus,
making the best of his impotence.</p>

<p>The Russians have suddenly started a new air. A
tenor sings the first phrase in solo. A bass joins in.
Then the other voices take up their parts. It is
beautiful, with a rough, serious, wild beauty. I ask
the title. <i>The Song of the War against Japan.</i>
Then they give some love songs. It seems to me
that all voice the same music, a powerful and melancholy,
and yet simple music, with the sweet notes of
infinite submission. I think of a grand Gregorian
chant encompassing all the pleasures and all the wrongs
of earth in an atmosphere of the eternal. The strains
have a bourdon of lamentation, like that of a woman
spent with suffering asking sympathy and consolation.</p>

<p class="tb">Next day the Bavarians of the guard could hardly
believe their eyes. In the courts, in the ditches, everywhere,
among basins and heaps of underclothing, quite
a tribe of naked little fathers were glistening in the
sunshine. How thin they were! To what skeletons
they had been reduced by two months in Germany.
Smiling, making awkward little gestures, each one
of them allowed himself to be manipulated by a
Frenchman, who soaped him all over, rubbed him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
down, pummelled him, dried him, and finally dressed
him as a French infantryman. “Now, then, we must
wash your duds. Come along.” And the French
mamma led his great little Slav to the well, helped
him to pump some water, arranged him a bench.
Then both set to work and scrubbed.</p>

<p>In the evening, when the roll was called, the
<i>Hauptmann</i> exclaimed: “But where on earth are the
Russians?”</p>

<p>“There they are,” answered Junot, sergeant-major
of No. 46.</p>

<p>“But what is the meaning of this masquerade?”</p>

<p>“Mon commandant, their clothes are drying on the
slopes, and you see they could not attend muster in
a loin cloth.”</p>

<p>These first days were pleasant. It was good to make
friends. To share without thought of the morrow, to
live without calculation, to act solely as the heart
dictated—it was like paradise. Yes, paradise within
prison walls. We were brothers. Even the veterans
of Manchuria and the Afghanistan campaigns, with
all their tinsmith’s shop of commemorative medals
and their grizzled heads, even the sergeants with three
stripes, had become our little brothers. “You are
hungry? Here is some white bread from France;
here is some home-made jam; here are some apples
from my orchard. Eat, Russki.” Or it would be:
“You old zebra, what are you doing that for, digging
the lice out of the seams of your clothes with a
knife? You’re sowing them all over the place. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
kind of grain sprouts. Look, this is the way.
Tic! Tic! Take your thumbs to it and press the
beast between the two nails. Kill, kill! It’s inhumane?
Never mind. Kill away. Have no compunction.”
So the Russian “zebra” sets to work to
crush his live-stock. They now divest themselves of
lice quite after the French manner, and no longer
swarm with vermin as when they arrived. But they
can still while away their long hours of leisure in
parasitological investigations and in slaughter.</p>

<p class="tb">Every evening the French and the Russians walk
arm in arm on the slopes. In less than no time a
conventional language has sprung into being. It does
not lead very far. No matter. When the mimic
vocabulary is exhausted, the friends walk side by side
in silence. But if a Bavarian sentry passes, the conversation
is resumed, the same things being emphatically
repeated; they clap one another on the back,
they exchange head-gear, képi for toque, fatigue-cap
for its Russian equivalent. After a few days the
Russian buttons stamped with the two-headed eagle
had found their way on to our coats, while the French
grenade buttons were displayed upon the huge Russian
earth-coloured cloaks. Tartar feet were encased in
French army shoes; while red trousers were tucked
into the supple boots of Ukraine leather. Early
Christian communism prevailed. Every one dressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
as he fancied, mixing the uniform of the two armies.
For an entire week the height of the fashion in Nos.
44 and 46, aristocratic regions, was to walk out in
moujiks’ blouses. Le Second, Poiret’s pupil, had work
after his own heart. Little Mitka’s blouse, a brilliant
grey-green, embroidered in black at the collar and
wristbands, was his great triumph.</p>

<p>Gradually the little fathers came to understand that
they must not kiss our hands, and that genuflexions
were by no means to our taste. It must be admitted
that they found this repugnance somewhat troublesome,
the repugnance of men who make a cult of
equality. They love direct demonstrations. They
are nearer to the days of the Iliad than to ’89, fond
of physical endearments like children and the early
Greeks, and a trifle fawning. But so winsomely!
Besides, they had to show us their gratitude. If
instead of the forbidden gestures they made us an
oration, we raised our hands to heaven, saying: “<i>Nye
ponimayu</i>—I don’t understand!” What were they to
do? Yesterday one of them, in despair, threw himself
upon the ground, kissing my footsteps in a transport
of delight. Impatiently I seized him, and
dragged him to his feet rather roughly. You should
have seen him, awkward, speechless, and motionless.
His silence seemed to say: “Why do you forbid me
to embrace you, to kiss the dust beneath your feet?
Do you not care for my gratitude? And yet you
are kindly. Or do you prefer our simple ‘thanks,’
our <i>spasiba</i>, to which your French jokers invariably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
respond by a long word which I can’t understand,
saying, ‘Non, pas si bas! Plus haut!’ Do you really
think that a word has any <i>body</i> in it if it be unaccompanied
by action?”</p>

<p>It was thus that they reasoned within themselves,
timid and embarrassed, when we repelled their embraces.
Then, struck with a sudden idea, they took the brooms
from our hands, they seized the shoes that we were
polishing, they ran to fetch water for us. In order to
give body to their <i>spasiba</i>, they did all our work for us.
Soon it was impossible for the Frenchmen to find any
occupation for their hands. In the dark corridor leading
to the great well, where the prisoners have to wait in a
long queue for their turn, shouldering pitchers stamped
with blue lozenges, one now saw none but Russians;
in the kitchens, when the potatoes were being peeled,
none but Russians; in the corner of the courts where
the laundrymen install buckets and tables, none but
Russians. We had to take severe measures, and to
insist that France should take a hand in all the hard
work.</p>

<p>But, amid this fine zeal, the Moslem Tartars take their
ease on their palliasses, quiet and blissful. Let others
perform all the arduous tasks. Christians and Jews can
scour the cement floors of the casemates, shake the rugs,
fold up the bedding, carry the <i>Kartoffelbrot</i><a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> from the
tumbrel to the storeroom. Impassive, crushing you by
the glassy immobility of their introspective gaze,
indolent as mandarins (whom they resemble in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
yellow tint, their wide cheek-bones, and their fine,
shining moustaches), it seems as if the Prophet had
furnished them with an opiate against all the accidents
of life. Nothing moves them. They ask for nothing.
They never share anything. They never pray. Do
them a service; give them something from your own
narrow resources; they take it all as a matter of course.
Some of them have two or three wives. Without a
sign of tenderness, they show you the portraits of these
wives, fraternizing in a single photograph. Plenty,
scarcity; cold, heat; a concourse, solitude; war, exile—everything
is alike to them. Life breaks impotently
against the bovine torpor of their fatalism.</p>

<p>But when the Christian Russians say their morning
prayer, standing bare-headed, multiplying triple signs of
the cross, kissing the Testament, and abasing themselves
before the little painted icon in a glass case fixed
to the wall above their palliasse, it sometimes happens
that their inhuman eyes blaze. They utter a raucous
cry: “Your Lord Jesus Christ, he’s no good!” Thereupon
the devotees break off their Paternosters, and
attack the scoffers with foot or with fist in order to
avenge the insult to their deity.</p>

<p>In casemate 34 there are ten Frenchmen, twelve
Russians, and one Jew. Thin, sickly, with a stoop, a
sallow complexion, a timid and plaintive expression,
this Jew is the most unobtrusive of men. He seems
afraid of taking up too much room. When spoken to
he is abashed and stammers. He never asks for anything.
He is always content. If you merely smile at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
him, he looks at you humbly, with a dumb, gentle
gratitude.</p>

<p>As he knows some German, I have been able to talk
to him. He is a good little soul, peaceful and inoffensive,
rather dull-witted. He contemplates the
knout and the pogroms without indignation, accepting
them as a farmer accepts hail. The only pleasure he
knows is the negative one of being left unnoticed, of
being forgotten, but this pleasure he welcomes as a
wonderful act of grace. In a word, he is one of the
humble of heart to whom the Rabbi rejected of the
rabbis has promised the kingdom of heaven.</p>

<p>One day, when I was bringing him an orange, his
compatriots leapt upon me from their palliasses, surrounding
me and restraining me by force from approaching
the Jew, pointing him out with a gesture of disgust,
as if to preserve me from a horrible contagion.</p>

<p>“Jew! Jew!” they cried with flashing eyes.</p>

<p>They were all speaking at once, so that I was
bewildered by their volubility and their passionate
gesticulations. Desiring to clear up the difficulty, I
sought an interpreter, and as soon as we returned, the
cries were redoubled.</p>

<p>“What are they all saying?” I demanded of Issajoff,
the interpreter. “Why are they holding me back like
this?”</p>

<p>Issajoff smiled. “Here is something,” he said,
“which wins me over to France! You’re astonished
that these Russians prevent you giving help to a Jew,
that they insist on assuring you that he is a Jew. To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
them it seems self-evident that as soon as you know
him to be a Jew you will no longer wish to give him
anything, but will treat him as a leper, a pariah, a
damned soul!”</p>

<p>The Russians continued to scream, to look murderously
at the Jew, to shake their fists at him. As for
him, with his customary air of dull indifference, he
remained quietly in his own corner behind the door,
beside the dustbin and the spittoon, the dirtiest and
dampest corner of the casemate.</p>

<p>Said Issajoff: “They say to him, ‘You have crucified
our Lord Jesus Christ’—‘I have defiled your mother’—this
is the grossest insult in our language. They
also say to him, ‘You love the Germans; if you
could, you would have shot us.’ They also say: ‘If
you accept the Frenchman’s present, we will flay
you alive!’”</p>

<p>Issajoff is a revolutionist—and a Jew, although he
keeps this last fact to himself. Coldly and deliberately
he reported to me his comrades’ words. But the vague
smile which played over his large features indicated
irony and contempt.</p>

<p>“You really find this scene surprising?” he resumed.</p>

<p>I contemplated these disciples of the Christ, all
yapping at this poor wretch. For the first time in my
life I found my Christianity a heavy burden.</p>

<p>I went up to Kajedan. I pressed him by the hand
and gave him the orange. I wanted to give him the
contents of my cigarette case, but he said he did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
smoke. “Well, give them to your friends.” He did
so. The Russians greedily seized the <i>papirosy</i>. They
threw themselves on their palliasses, and, forgetting
to avenge their God any longer, they gave themselves
up to the delights of tobacco.</p>

<h2 id="VASSILI">VASSILI</h2>

<p class="right"><i>July 1, 1915.</i></p>

<p>I am Vassili’s <i>barin</i> (seigneur). He polishes my shoes;
every morning, in the court, he brings me water for my
“teube”; he picks up balls for me in our extemporized
game of tennis; if I am thirsty, he runs to the well; if
the cloth of my worn trousers, too skimpy for me (the
government has never been able to supply me with
trousers suited to my figure), gives way during an
unusually vigorous movement of Swedish gymnastics,
he promptly threads a needle and repairs the damage;
he watches over me as one watches milk on the boil;
no valet has ever served me so well. But what
constrains him?</p>

<p>Were I to forbid him to serve me, he would shed
bitter tears. Have I ever given him an order? Have
I ever been short with him? Is Vassili my valet
or my friend? He no longer kisses my hands, he
no longer kisses my lips, he no longer kisses the
ground where I have trod. He has given up these
moujik ways. He simply shakes hands with me.
When I am at work, he sits on my ration-chest or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
stands at the window, smoking <i>papirosy</i> (cigarettes), and
looking at the illustrations in my books. When he likes
them he exclaims “<i>Harosho, harosho!</i>” (good, good).
But always I feel his faithful Siberian eye upon me.
He divines the least of my wishes. Do I need a book?
He knows perfectly to whom it has been lent. He
jumps up, runs along the corridors, finds the man,
maybe in his casemate, maybe beneath the shade of a
poplar, maybe in one of the ditches, explains himself in
nigger talk, and, breathless and perspiring, comes back
to me with the prize. It can hardly be said that we
converse; the difficulties are too great. We look at
one another, and we smile. He gives me everything he
can; I respond in kind. He works; I work. He serves
me; I serve him. I know how to read and write; I
can influence the <i>Feldwebel</i>; and I can ask my relatives
and friends in France to send me things. For his part,
he knows how to darn, patch, fetch water, wash up.
Thus, side by side, each at his own task, we both work.
He imagines that I am a <i>barin</i>, in which he is mistaken,
and that I love him, in which he is not mistaken. For
my part, I regard him as a good fellow from Tomsk,
who pines for his <i>izba</i> (cottage) and his wife, and I
would like to send him back to them in good condition
when his imprisonment is over.</p>

<h2 id="THE_COMMON_PEOPLE_OF_GERMANY">THE COMMON PEOPLE OF GERMANY
AND THE WAR</h2>

<p class="right"><i>July 7, 1915.</i></p>

<p>It has lasted for eleven months. How much longer
will it continue?</p>

<p>Our sentries are even more impatient than we are
ourselves. They grumble and faultfind. “It is too
bad!” they exclaim. “Do you think it will be over
in a month?” they ask us. “Pooh!” we answer; “in
a year perhaps, or maybe two, when we have conquered
the autocracy which tyrannizes over you!”
They stare at us blankly, utterly disheartened.</p>

<p>These poor fellows are suffering. They have many
children, six, seven, or eight. Their savings are
exhausted, and the wolf is at the door. When we are
marching to work, they recount their troubles to Brissot
and to me, confidingly and deferentially, as they would
to an elder brother. They are good by nature, simple-minded,
somewhat subservient, weighted by innumerable
centuries of silent submission. One perceives so
clearly that they have not effected their revolution, and
that despite parliamentary suffrage and the Reichstag
they are still under the dominion of the feudal age.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>Through studying them closely, and through talking
with them, it seems to me that I am beginning to
understand this huge and mysterious Germany. I
knew something of the élite of the country, but was
quite ignorant of the common people, workmen,
peasants, and lower middle class. But these are the
backbone of Germany.</p>

<p>How different is their world from ours! In France we
read the paper; we have political ideas; we influence the
appointment of ministers; we take sides passionately,
for or against Pelletan, for or against Clemenceau, for or
against Poincaré; every one of our village orators has
good advice to give to our admirals, our generals, and our
diplomats. How unlike Germany! Nothing can equal
the ignorance of these folk in public matters. Think
of a French agriculturist of the days of Louis XIV,
hardworking and kindly, engrossed in domestic cares,
knowing that it is hard to gain a livelihood and occupied
in this pursuit by day and by night; accepting princes,
seigneurs, taxes, corvées, and wars as one accepts sunshine,
rain, hail, and frost, without venturing to pass
any judgment upon them; saying that these things
have been, are, and will be, that he himself is but a
poor man, that every one has his own trade, that it is
the king’s to govern and his to provide a living for
his family; there you have the political essence of
the German peasant and the German workman.
Monarchy, republic, foreign relations, double alliance
or triple alliance—don’t waste your time talking to
him about these. Should you do so, he will listen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
he will express a civil assent, and will fall asleep over
his beer.</p>

<p>A Frenchman cannot understand how utterly indifferent
are the common people in Germany to political
ideas and to questions of state. A Frenchman, whether
he knows it or not, and even if he believes himself to
be a monarchist, reasons like a leader. He speaks as if
he were himself a part of the king, and a considerable
part. He eagerly discusses the affairs of the country.
Militarist or anti-militarist, he is patriotic to the core—patriotic
like the sovereign he is. Should the foreigner
insult France, he is personally insulted; this is his own
business; the offence is not offered to some distant
prince; it touches himself, the individual king; it
makes his own skin tingle. This was obvious at the
mobilization; it remains obvious after a year of war.
It is not simply a caste which detests the Kaiser and
his satellites and wishes to subdue them; these feelings
animate every Frenchman, be he minister or cobbler.
For France, one and indivisible, is truly <i>a free nation</i>,
a collection of autonomous individuals who have determined
to live together, who know themselves to have
been entrusted with the most exalted of human missions,
and each one of whom makes the fulfilment of that
mission a point of personal honour.</p>

<p>How different is Germany! The country possesses
an élite of persons well equipped for administration and
rule, and this endows her national life with a fine
aspect of cohesion. But directly we examine more
closely, doubts arise; we see that the cohesion is no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
more than apparent; there are those who theorize about
Germany as a whole, but there is not <i>one</i> Germany;
between the people and the leaders there is no intimate
solidarity, no communion of love, hope, and will.
Above, there is an empyrean of men who believe themselves
superhuman, who utter claims, trace plans, issue
orders (<i>Befehle</i>), who, as if at section drill, thunder out
commands to Germany and to the world at large;
below, there is a swarm of good and peaceable folk, all
engaged in their insignificant private affairs, and making
no attempt to interfere in the loftier mysteries.</p>

<p>Doubtless, in the lower regions, respect is felt for the
empyrean; people tremble before it, as before the eye
of God; but there is no risk that they will attempt to
penetrate its designs. They are faithful subjects, and
they obey. They are soldiers when the time comes for
enrolment, and good soldiers; when the order for
mobilization is issued, they go to the war; when the
ritual demands it, they shout hurrahs “for king and
country.” But at bottom, if words have any meaning,
they are not patriots. Militarists, yes; easily
regimented, yes; patriots, no.</p>

<p>It is true that they would be greatly astonished if
any one were to say to them point-blank: “You don’t
care a fig for your country!” They all believe themselves
to be good, honest, and loyal Germans. Are
they not obedient to the death? Certainly they are.
But they would be equally obedient, with very little
feeling of disturbance at the change, to George V or
to Poincaré; and they would obey just as well in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
republic as in a monarchy. It is not their business to
be patriots (for this presupposes a degree of liberty,
and of internal sovereignty, to which they have not yet
attained), but to be good subjects. To obey, unfailingly
and without discussion; to abase themselves devoutly
before authority; to be subservient to their leader,
whoever he may be; to carry out orders whencesoever
derived, be they democratic or be they Cæsarian—this
it is to be a good German. Active as he is in private
affairs, he is passive in religion, with a sort of mystical
fervour, and he is passive in his relationships to authority.
The Germans hardly realize this, and yet to us it is
so obvious.</p>

<p>Here is an example. On one occasion I, a prisoner
of war, roundly reprimanded a sentry, reproaching him
with disobedience to orders. Secretly I was laughing,
but the sentry trembled. Standing at attention as if
confronted by an officer, he trembled before the majesty
of the command, the <i>Befehl</i>. I had issued an order,
and that is why he stood to attention; there he was,
submissive, stupefied with willingness; he forgot that I
was a Frenchman, subject to his orders, that the regulations
forbade me to speak to him, that he should have
charged bayonet and touched me with the steel, even
run me through. No, I had issued an order; the man
who commands, who gives a <i>Befehl</i>, is sacrosanct for
the German.</p>

<p>The reason is that the German has never emerged
from private life. He lives in his house, on his land, in
his factory, his tavern, his church; he lives with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
family, with a few friends, with his professional
associates. He makes his life there as agreeable as
possible; he is an able domestic economist, knowing
well how to adorn his residence, his table, his savings
bank. The currents of modern life, socialism, liberalism,
materialism, the religion of comfort and of hygiene,
have developed his practical aptitudes to an unimaginable
extent, to a degree unsuspected in France. But no
current of modern life has induced him to touch the
holy of holies, the government; to discuss the constitution,
the bureaucracy, or the army; to investigate the
essential problems of political life. Even the boldest
among them does not lose his veneration for constituted
authority. In fine, there is but one domain in which
he is free, that of economic life. Here, therefore, his
energy is concentrated, and within this sphere his
thoughts are confined. Here he is master; here none
can equal him in perseverance and tenacity; here he
risks everything and makes trial of everything;
unceasingly he innovates; he is hindered by no
prejudice: the poverty of recent days spurs him
on and makes wealth seem marvellously appetizing;
in a decade he transforms a province; in three decades
he makes of Germany a fragment of America in
the heart of Europe. We are forced to recognize that
Germany is the “Marius’s mule” of the economic
world.</p>

<p>But this suffices him. Formerly he possessed the
clouds, but he has bartered the inheritance for the
markets of the world. He boasted of being Greek,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
but he is now content to be Carthaginian. He
makes money, and he knows nothing more.</p>

<p>And authority? Does he not know authority? Yes,
he knows it, but as something grand and remote, as a
sort of divinity which might do him harm, and which
he must render favourable or at least indifferent. He
knows it as an average Christian knows the invisible.
He believes in it, but continues to mind his own business;
he is not jealous of it and has no desire to share
its exercise; he gives it his confidence, and pays it a
certain worship of an unexacting character; above all,
he asks that authority should help him to make money;
in that case he finds everything good—the Kaiser, the
bureaucracy, the army.</p>

<p>This utilitarian loyalty is especially characteristic of
the wealthy German. As far as those of small means
are concerned, they recognize that outside private life,
beyond the family, the factory, the tavern, and the
trade-union, there exists something that is great, divine,
and unknowable. In the highest degree of the unknowable,
in close proximity to God, the saints, and the hero
Siegfried, there exists authority: emperor, princes,
generals, diplomatists, ministers. All this is an immense
and unfathomable ocean, primitive and sacred;
but he, poor mollusc, rooted to his rock, is concerned
solely with the tiny region upon which his valves open.
And when the terrible convulsion of the powers of the
abyss, of the sceptred, gold-laced, and helmeted majesties,
rages athwart him, shaking his frail habitation, he
trembles, simultaneously inspired with dread and with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
love, and he murmurs his abjection and his devotion in
inarticulate words. When all is over, forgetting the
gods that have passed, the gods that glitter, shout at him,
and sometimes kick and chastise him, he conscientiously
resumes the task of loving his wife, of procreating as
many children and of earning as many marks as possible.</p>

<p>After all, the German of no account is utilitarian
in his loyalty. He does not, like the wealthy German,
demand that his government shall deliver the universe
into his hands, so that he may inundate it with wares
great and small “made in Germany.” He is less exacting.
He asks merely for work and a livelihood. But
upon this his desire is firmly fixed. He has become
accustomed to a certain degree of comfort—quite
recently, it is true, but the newest pleasure is ever the most
attractive. He wants to get his belly well-lined during
the week, and to be able on Sundays to go with his
<i>gnädige Frau</i> and his quiverful of children, all smartly
dressed, to drain several dozen tankards of beer, and to
spend the entire afternoon, laughing boisterously, in the
arbours of neighbouring <i>Wirtschaften</i>. He likes to
think proudly that his father lived in poverty, but that
he lives at ease. He likes to imagine that no workman
in the world is happier than the German workman. As
long as he has a full stomach, he can believe that all is
well. The government can do what it likes, can ally
itself to Austria or to France, can be licentious or
strait-laced, can obey or disobey the Reichstag. He
himself, trusty Michael, is well off. Germany, therefore,
is great, the world is perfect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>I have gradually been able to fathom this state of
mind through more or less clandestine conversations
with the soldiers who guard us and the peasants who
employ us at twenty pfennig for the day of nine hours.
Notwithstanding all the patriotic songs with which the
recruits make the roads resound, and notwithstanding
all the pratings of the pulpit and the school, I am
now confident that the affairs of the fatherland are
not Michael’s affairs. Whether it be that the degree
of economic emancipation he has attained supplements
or reinforces his ingrained instinct of submission
to authority, in any case, the ancient sentiment,
quasi-religious in nature, and the new sentiment,
thoroughly utilitarian, lead to the same result, a concern
with nothing but private affairs, political indifference,
so that one can even say that in the world of
politics the common German is a mere cipher.</p>

<p>This state of mind has its advantages. It is favourable
to the maintenance of public order. Since everyone
rests content in his own sphere, there is no friction,
there is no waste of energy, no mutual suspicion between
the classes. Authority, certain of its durability, can
take long views, it has elbow-room. Whilst those in
authority are loved, they can give themselves up to
their natural bent, which is to regulate—to regulate the
workman at home, the employer abroad; to wrap themselves
in purple, to cut a dash, to astonish the universe.
All these things are done for their own sake, for the
pleasure they give, but they serve also to shed a
reflected glory on German commerce. This political<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
nullity of the crowd has hitherto had good results. But
hitherto the crowd has consisted of fat kine. Association
with the worthy Michael day after day in these
times when every one is rationed, when poverty and
death stalk abroad, has led me to think that the political
nullity of the people, precious to those in authority,
is hardly likely to produce a tenacious and trustworthy
patriotism, and that in the long run it may well eventuate
in disaster.</p>

<p class="tb">For nearly a year I have been studying life in this
corner of Germany. I observe, I ask questions, and I
listen. They are now quite tamed. No longer do they
cry death on us. No longer do they call out <i>kaput</i>,
except as a joke. In the villages, when the working
gang arrives, the children flock to the scene from all
directions, bare-footed, somewhat timid, at once shy and
smiling. They have heard their fathers say that the
French are splendid soldiers, “the only ones who can
hold their ground against the grey-blues.” The description
has raised us in these youngsters’ esteem. They
know, too, that we receive parcels, many parcels. They
believe us to be extraordinarily wealthy. The gossips
even state with definite assurance that there are six
millionaires and one multi-millionaire at Fort Orff;
and, for what reason I know not, I am the multi-millionaire.
This little world is astonished that persons
of such eminence, terrible on the battlefield, should be so
friendly with their humble selves. The German bourgeois
and the junkers, we gather, have less agreeable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
manners. Finally, the villagers have been informed
that our prison society is a true republic, that we have
suppressed all distinctions of fortune, that the “sans-parcels”
gain just as much advantage from the coming
of the French mail as the “little-parcels” and the “big-parcels.”
This communism, natural as it seems to us,
touches and vanquishes them.</p>

<p>The fact is that the children and the members of the
working gang fraternize. Some of the poor women
secretly offer us an apple or an egg. The old men
salute us humbly. One of us was addressed as “Most
honoured sir,” another as “Highly well-born sir.” Even
those who have been discharged from service on account
of severe wounds, men with empty sleeves and horribly
scarred faces, no longer glare at us with the murderous
hatred they showed at the outset.</p>

<p>At Ingolstadt, when we are waiting for our parcels in
the square in front of the <i>Kommandantur</i>, civilians
come and go before our group and converse with us.
The women are particularly attentive. They recognize
monsieur Pierre, “who had a frightful wound, and who,
God be thanked, is now quite well again”; monsieur
Paul, “who …”; monsieur Jacques, “who …” They
smile broadly when we call them to order, quoting to
them the phrases in which one of the newspapers the
night before has censured them for their friendliness to
the prisoners. Little do they care what the papers say.
The sentry growls at them, but they tell him to his
face that the <i>Franzosen</i> are pre-eminently “cholis” and
“chantils.” Some of the better educated go so far as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
admit that “a red-trousers is worth quite as much as
a <i>Feldgrau</i>,” and that “it is all nonsense to say, as
people do, that France is decadent.”</p>

<p>Yesterday, some of the gang were talking to a hoary-headed
postman.</p>

<p>“Well, daddy, how goes it?” said Bracke, who can
speak the Franconian patois.</p>

<p>“Very well, gentlemen, very well!” There he stood,
not knowing what to say. He had taken off his <i>Mütze</i>
and was wiping his forehead to keep himself in countenance.
Then, all at once:</p>

<p>“It grieves me,” stammering slightly, “to think that
we are at war with you.…”</p>

<p>“Nou, nou, old chap, we’re not at war with you!
Our quarrel is with the big guns of your country.
They’re a bad lot; they oppress you, and would like
to oppress the whole world. But you’re a <i>poteau</i>!
(<i>Du bist ein poteau</i>).”</p>

<p>“<i>Poteau</i>, what’s that?”</p>

<p>“A comrade, a chum.”</p>

<p>The postman had tears in his eyes. “Ah,” he
exclaimed, “it does me good to hear you say that. I
love the French. You are so awfully nice to every
one. You don’t despise the common people.”</p>

<p>“Here, old general, here’s a cheroot which my
missus has sent me. Happily France keeps us supplied,
as you know. All the same, we intend to give a good
hiding to your old Kaiser and all your bigwigs. We
are republican. Liberty, equality, and fraternity.
Live and let live is our motto. But any one who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
meddles with us had better look out. Damn it all!
why don’t you kick your dirty old Kaiser into the
sewer? Never mind! We shall set you free, and be
jolly quick about it.”</p>

<p>The postman, dumbfounded, lit his cigar at the
wrong end.</p>

<p>Yes, they have changed greatly since our coming.
The dogma of French decadence, with which they had
been sedulously indoctrinated, no longer finds credence.
They join with us in making fun of it. It is amusing to
see these humble folk, who have always been treated
with disdain by their superiors, whether civil or
military, accept us as intimate friends. They feel
flattered when they can talk to us on a footing of
democratic equality, for they do not fail to recognize
our superiority, and they are greatly touched that we
never abuse it. They feel that we are sincere in our
hatred of the pride of caste. They applaud our
republican speeches. In return, they confide to us
their grievances and their despair. The poor devils
are absolutely unanimous in detesting this horrible
butchery.</p>

<p>It is unquestionable that the terrible burden of the
war—the most terrible burden of death, weariness,
and misery, that has ever weighed humanity down—presses
more heavily upon their shoulders than upon
ours. We have been held up in the trenches since
September. On their side, for a year they have had
no respite. Alternately victors and vanquished, upon
the eastern front there continually occurs some new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
gigantic action, like that of the Marne. Day after
day there is a savage attack in full force. Day after
day there is a massacre. More than three and a
half million Germans are fattening the soil of Galicia
and Poland; more than ten millions have been
wounded. And why? In defence? “Ah,” they say
to us, “if you only knew how little we care whether we
are French or Prussian! Give us peace, give us peace!”</p>

<p>They no longer believe that the war is a war of
defence. They have heard their non-commissioned
officers, men of the middle class, cursing Austria for
having led them into this hateful business. The idea
has become current in the villages where the troops
are quartered. Exasperated by their sufferings, the
soldiers are murmuring. Many would like to desert.
They understand perfectly that they are the victims
of a caste of nobles and manufacturers mad with pride.
They still obey, but they grumble. A German
grumbler is a new phenomenon.</p>

<p>“Every one hates us,” declared in my hearing a
young workman from Upper Franconia. “Every one
in the world except the Pope and the Turks. There
can be no doubt that our rulers wanted everything
for themselves. They told us, too, that the French
nation was crumbling and would fall to pieces at
a touch. What rot! We know well enough that you
are splendid soldiers.”</p>

<p>“I was in the Vosges,” said a sentry of the 13th
Bavarians. “Your chasseurs alpins are perfect
fiends!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>“I was on the Yser,” commented another. “I
shan’t forget your colonial infantrymen in a hurry!”</p>

<p>He made me come near the lamp to see his wound.</p>

<p>“Old man,” I rejoined, “my younger brother, a
colonial infantryman, was also wounded in the fight
on the Yser.”</p>

<p>“We have been made fools of,” they declare without
exception. “You are not decadent! Far from it!
Nor are your cannon. Fine tales they fed us up
with! If our leaders had been the humanitarians
they claim to be, it is obvious that we should have
a few friends somewhere in the world. We should not
have every one against us. And we poor devils have
to pay for the folly. It’s altogether too bad! Oh
that peace may come quickly! Take Alsace-Lorraine
if you like. What on earth does it matter? Take
anything. What difference does it make to us
whether we are governed from Paris or from Berlin?”</p>

<p>A fat <i>Unteroffizier</i> spoke as follows:</p>

<p>“I honestly prefer the French to the Prussians.
The French are good fellows. They feel compassion;
they share their bread with us. But the Prussians!
It’s kicks we get from them. A pack of swelled-heads
who imagine they can do anything they like,
who want everything for themselves, who bamboozle
their own people and refuse to give them any rights!
There is but one thing we want: to live at peace
with the world. Instead of that they make us go
and kill. Why? Does any one know why? What
do we gain by it? The villages are full of widows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
and disabled men. It is even worse in the towns,
where lots of working-class families are positively
starving. You fellows are lucky. France is rich.
France can send parcels to her prisoners. All that
we can do is to draw our belts tighter. They lead
us to the slaughter while they leave our wives and
children to suffer. And how it drags. Peace! Let’s
have done with it! Peace at any price!”</p>

<p>For the last six months I have not heard a single
German soldier use any other language than this.
Wounded returning to the front, men of the <i>Landwehr</i>
or the <i>Landsturm</i> on their way to the fighting-line,
they are unanimous. If but the tenth part of their
private grumblings were to be translated into action
there would be revolution throughout the country.</p>

<p>To speak frankly, these mutterings do not evoke
my admiration. They are not the fruit of an indignant
conscience, they do not manifest the reaction of
inner freedoms which have been outraged and deceived,
and which come to their own again in the form of a
reasserted dignity. One hears in them nothing but
the cry of the beaten and overloaded mule. He
wants his peaceful stable, bran, fresh water, warm
and comfortable litter. But there is no occasion to
be alarmed, for he dreads the whip, and his master is
an adept in drubbing him all the way up the hill.</p>

<p>For Michael can hardly be said to have become
more spiritual-minded since the empire was founded.
In former days he was extremely poor. He was
frugal. He was fond of music and of dreaming, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
was addicted to a mystical piety. A serf before men,
he felt free in the presence of God, his God of the
gospels, gentle and affectionate, <i>mein lieber Gott</i>. To-day
he is fairly well-to-do. He is still a serf, more of
a serf than ever, in relation to those in authority, the
nobility, officers in the army, and employers; but he
no longer endeavours to find freedom at God’s hands.
His new cult is that of a cosy fireside, with good
victuals and a barrel of beer. In a word, he has
become an egoist. He now thinks only of himself, of
his personal interests, of his trade unions which protect
his wages, of his co-operative societies which secure
his comforts. Without realizing it, through ignoring
politics, through taking no interest in the workings of
authority, through thinking solely of his own private
affairs, he has slipped into the acceptance of that base
doctrine which finds expression in the ancient formula,
<i>Ubi bene, ibi patria</i>—“My country is the place where
I am well off!”</p>

<p>Last July, when he was luxuriating in his petty good
fortune, he cried with his masters, “<i>Deutschland über
alles!</i>” At his drinking parties he vociferated jingo
songs. Some of the megalomania of the Olympians
was fermenting in his body, indiscriminately mingled
with beer and sausages. In this mood he saw himself
mounting in company with his Germania, mounting
continuously to attain the topmost summit of glory
and strength. Then he loved his Germania. She was
so powerful. It was thus that she had always been
depicted to him, as a robust and formidable matron,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
not altogether amiable, imposing her will with peremptory
fists, but providing her children with such good
things to eat and drink, with all the comforts they
could desire. How can one help loving a person like
this when one is a poor devil who has only just
emerged from poverty?</p>

<p>Now the war has begun. Germania is at length to
become queen of the world. Forward! Good Michael
sets out for Paris. It will soon be over. A fortnight
or so. A simple wedding journey. Just think of it:
Rheims, and champagne in floods; Paris, the little
women, all the delights of Babylon. For, after all,
France, as every one knows, is ours for the taking.
Forward!</p>

<p>Forward! But, confound it all, there are some hard
knocks! Paris is just over there, but what an inferno
of fire to get through first! I say, we’re retreating now!
We’re leaving a lot of good Germans on the stubbles
and in the ponds of the Marne. What a massacre!
They have been fooling us, it seems. The French
can beat us after all: in fact, they have already given
us a good licking.</p>

<p>“But there’s no end to it. How bitter winter seems
in the trenches. Always more dead, and more, and
more. My feet are freezing. I am badly fed. Oh, my
slippers, my nice, comfortable slippers, my darling wife
who used to light my long pipe for me, and who used
to cuddle me warm in bed! <i>Sakrament!</i> What’s this
horrible war about? They told me it would be such
an easy matter. After all, what do I, good, honest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
Michael, care about ruling the world? Must I pay for
<i>this</i> with <i>my</i> skin? No, no; I’m only a poor man.
What business is it of mine, this ruling of the world?
Oh, <i>lieber Gott</i>, let the war end soon, let me get back to
my village, my pub, my bed, and my children!”</p>

<p>Thus has Michael reasoned, and thus he continues to
reason. It is not heroic. Sancho Panza would shake
him by the hand as a true comrade. Still, why should
Michael be a Don Quixote? Has Germany ever
claimed to be a Dulcinea? Has she manifested herself
to him as charming, winsome, gentle, and maternal, as
loving him unselfishly for his own sake? Nothing of
the sort! On the contrary, Germany has terrorized him
with rough orders, and has made him efface himself by
her display of aggressive force. She has appealed to
the traditional servility of his imagination, not to the
nobility of his heart. She has desired obedience, not
affection.</p>

<p>Now the great hour has arrived, the gloomy hour of
sacrifice. It is not enough to sing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Lieb Vaterland, magst ruhig sein.…</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">No, one simply has to die so that the country one loves
may live.</p>

<p>Love is an easy word to say. We have so often been
told that the Germans loved Germany, that they were
the true patriots, while we, the French, were nothing but
anarchists. Yet, after a year of war, these Gallic
“grumblers,” who are always wrangling, who take ideas
into their heads, and who hold to these ideas so firmly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
that you sometimes hear them cry, “Perish countries,
so long as principle lives and humanity becomes
established”—these ungovernable and intractable
“anarchists” remain a single body and soul, exhibit
infinite patience, and continue the most formidable
warlike efforts. Why? Are they inconsistent? Not
for a moment. For them, France is justice; France is
the human ideal. They save their souls by saving
France. They can die, for they would not wish to go
on living if beautiful Europe were to fall beneath the
German yoke.</p>

<p>But why should you expect these little Michaels of
Germany to die cheerfully? Why, as the slaughter
increases, should they stand shoulder to shoulder round
their leaders, firmly resolved to conquer or to perish?
Is Germany really worth dying for?</p>

<p>This much is certain, that the mystical admirers of
justice and liberty, who, in time of peace, filled the men
of order with dismay, are to-day the most disciplined in
the world; whilst the pillars of order, the singers of
unity, the adorers of powerful Germania, those who
made a mystical cult of force and force alone, have
taken to grumbling, are reasoning like ill-conditioned
individualists, have denied their faith.</p>

<p>I have noticed a thousand times that these Teuton
soldiers who, through dread of their leaders, are not yet
traitors in fact, are nevertheless traitors in soul.</p>

<p>This no longer surprises me. I understand why they
regard us without hatred, why they long for peace at
any price, and why, if the war is to continue, they look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
forward to being made prisoners. They suffer too much,
and their suffering has overwhelmed their patriotism.</p>

<p>Those only who love greatly can accept great
suffering. Their boasted affection for Germania was
nothing more than a fever of the imagination, a fictitious
suggestion, a sentiment for display. It was the fascination
felt by the ignorant for everything that glitters and
makes a brave noise. They loved Germania in her
success. They loved her triumphant, colossal, brobdingnagian.
They loved her as a parvenu loves wealth
and a gourmand good cheer. They loved her carnally,
a power of the flesh. Has any one ever seen such a
love accept sacrifice cheerfully and outlast misfortune?
No, the ideal alone is worth more than life. The ideal
alone evokes that wonderful love which increases with
suffering, the chaste and shy love which shuns display,
and which does not chant its pæans or unfurl the
beauties of its splendid wings until the hour of absolute
surrender. Now Germany has long ere this ceased to
be an ideal.</p>

<p>This is what it means to have nothing but force to
depend upon. When we lose it, we have lost all. This
is what it means to build upon egoism and the political
nullity of the masses. When the hour strikes for an
appeal to their heroism, we encounter nothing but a
soft and melancholy passivity.</p>

<p>But what an astounding organization it is which is
capable of neutralizing so much inadequacy of will, and
is able to make tough and efficient armies out of this
assemblage of worthless material!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CROSSING_SWITZERLAND">CROSSING SWITZERLAND</h2>

<p class="right"><i>July 31, 1915.</i></p>

<p>Our convoy crossed Switzerland last night. I should
have been sorry to be ill, ill with relief and happiness,
for this would have made it impossible to describe our
reception. It delighted and I must say it surprised me.</p>

<p>I know Switzerland well. I love it like a second
motherland. I am familiar with its history and its
institutions. I have made prolonged stays by the
shores of Lake Geneva, and dear friendships convinced
me long ere this that our two nations are animated by
the same instinct, the instinct of independence and
humanity. In the terrible duel now in progress I was
assured beforehand of the freely given sympathy of our
predecessors in the art of republican government.</p>

<p>I believed, nevertheless, that on our way through the
country we should find this sympathy, however true and
however certain, veiled and restrained.</p>

<p>From prudential considerations, first of all. Switzerland
is such a paradox! When a citizen of Lausanne
manifests his love for French civilization (in which he
has just as strong and legitimate an interest as any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
citizen of Orleans or Nancy), can he ever do so
without being afraid lest he may be wounding a fellow-Confederate
of Basle or Zurich? Supposing that his
manifestation should become generalized, and that it
should provoke a counter-manifestation, has he not
good reason to dread the consequences to Switzerland
of this spontaneous plebiscite? Would it not involve
the ruin of this nation with two hearts, if within its
frontiers war should suddenly be declared between the
two rival civilizations? If during our nocturnal journey
from Constance to Geneva we had encountered nothing
but gentle and calm faces, I should not, on that account,
have harboured any suspicions of my dear Switzerland.</p>

<p>I should have said to my companions:</p>

<p>“Continue to trust her; she loves us. This democracy
is tranquil, healthy, little inclined to use lofty phrases,
and by no means fond of scenes in the street; but she
has a robust faith in the right of nations. With all her
heart she detests aggressive imperialism and the cultured
barbarism of Germany. You will find her shy, reserved,
and circumspect; you will perhaps blame her for her
silence. But this would be wrong, for her silence is a
duty she owes to her patriotism. She is intensely
patriotic. She would like to hail you with acclamations,
but a great national obligation seals her lips. You
could not possibly wish her light-heartedly to do anything
owing to which German civilization and Latin
civilization might suddenly come into hostile conflict
within her closed borders, for she exists solely in virtue
of their mutual accord, and it is her historic mission to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
maintain the contact between them, to harmonize them,
to interpenetrate each with the other. This abominable
war is a difficult hour in her inner life. Even in times
of peace she has to walk circumspectly; but now, if
she is to avoid a disruption which is always possible,
she must control her every movement, must bridle her
tongue, swallow her burning words, the words of love
and admiration which, if she followed the dictates of
her heart, she would utter to her valiant sister and
neighbour. Believe me, my friends, the mountain
democracy is praying in her heart for the victory of
right, for our victory. Her silence is but a mask; she
is mute for reasons of state.”</p>

<p>I did not have to deliver this address. From one end
to the other of Switzerland, the Helvetian people, so
hostile to demonstrations, hailed us with acclamations.
They sat up all night. They overwhelmed us with gifts.
The seats of the train were heaped with ribbons,
cockades, flowers, boxes of cigars, baskets of food,
bottles of the celebrated vintages of Neuchâtel, La Côte,
Lavaux, and Yvorne. In my compartment alone we
filled six haversacks with cigars, which we sent to the
front to the 30th of the line, the regiment of poor
Robequain, of whose death I learned on reaching
Bellegarde.</p>

<p>Do not imagine that this explosion of generosity was
inspired by mere pity for the wreckage of war. I am
absolutely confident that it was inspired by love for
France. Burghers and peasants, children and old men,
in German Switzerland just as much as in French, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
all sang the <i>Marseillaise</i>. They waved the tricolor.
They cried, “<i>Vive la France!</i>” At the stops they
talked to us frankly, like brothers. They handed us
addresses which were hymns to “The Nation of Valmy
and of the Marne,” to “The Champions of the Rights
of Man,” to “The Citizen Army which has sworn to
conquer or die for the Advent of a Free Europe.”</p>

<p>It seemed to me that the proud Helvetians of
Morgarten and Sempach, these forefathers of democracy
and liberty, had emerged from their national
Grütli to line the road in our honour, and to give their
blessing to the sons of the young republic.</p>

<p>I cannot describe the mad jubilation which surged
through our veins. France! France the beloved!
France of our blood and our heart. France the eternal,
resuscitated by the German aggression, once more
become the champion of freedom. France hailed by
the neutrals, and by all men who respect the right!
I was drunk with happiness. This single night was
a compensation, for you, noble fellows mutilated in
the war; for you, my brother, with broken ear-drums
and split skull; and for you, my friends, all my dear
dead friends, who sleep in Lorraine, in Belgium, in
Flanders, and on the Marne.</p>

<p>“Battles and Bivouacs,” by Jacques Roujon, is a vivid recital of the
first six months of warfare. The language is direct and unaffected, soul-stirring,
and free from exaggeration; every page, nay, every line, compels
attention and evokes the most sympathetic interest. The book is alike
authentic and restrained in tone, but what most strikes the reader is its
extraordinary <i>sincerity</i>. No war book has yet appeared that gives so
strong an impression of reality, or which, on its own sheer merits, is more
worthy to survive the rage and tumult of battle.</p>

<p>In addition to making definite suggestions as to the lines on which the
Peace Movement should go to work after the war—suggestions which are
both obvious and practical—the book contains a reprint of a pamphlet
written by an upper-class native of Schleswig, with footnote criticisms by a
Prussian scholar of unbiassed views, which renders very sensational and
personal testimony to the terrible discontent and bitter rage which a
conquered nation feels in its humiliating position of subjection—thus
proving beyond all doubt that the chief obstacle that the Peace Movement
has to face is this unnatural denial to the conquered people of the Rights
of Peace.</p>

interesting volume. It will be preceded by a preface from the pen of
Mr. Ladislas Mickiewicz—the son of the great Polish poet—which will
state the attitude of the Polish people to Germany, and reveal how deeply
their sympathies are enlisted in the cause of the Allies. A notable feature
of the book will be a record of the attempts made by the Germans in
Poland during the last few months to seduce Poland from her confidence
in the justice of the Western Powers.</p>

<p class="book">The Financing of Fiona</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">By DOROTHEA CONYERS</span></p>

<p>“The Financing of Fiona” is a sporting story with love interest running
through it. The plot turns on Colonel Beresford’s will, written hurriedly
on notepaper, in which he leaves everything to his niece Fiona; but he
dies suddenly, and his nephew Challoner, though he does not think of
suppressing the will, takes out the centre sheet, so completely altering
everything that Fiona gets her uncle’s lovely old home but no income
with it. By this Challoner thinks that the girl is sure to marry him, and
that he will have both Kinvarragh and the money. But Fiona, left
penniless, determines to struggle and to take paying guests for the hunting.
Two men, Major Bohun and his nephew, come to her, and bring their
horses. Fiona fights with many troubles, and Major Bohun’s fears that
his nephew will marry her, together with hunting and shooting, make the
rest of the book. The troubles end in an unexpected manner, and Fiona
is left at Kinvarragh, but not alone.</p>

<p class="book">When the Wicked Man …</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">By GUY THORNE</span></p>

<p class="center smaller">Author of “When it was Dark”</p>

<p>Mr. Guy Thorne’s new novel, “When the Wicked Man …,” is one
of unusual and penetrating interest. It is a profound study of a bad
man’s soul, stripped bare and naked without equivocation or evasion.
If Maupassant had written this story it would have stopped at the third
book, and a brilliant but unutterably painful document would be all that
remained. Mr. Guy Thorne goes farther. He shows us the dark and
sensual soul of Sebastian Warde moving towards the Light, until the
wicked man at last turns from his wickedness, and, crushed, broken, and
empty, casts himself at the feet of God. The action of the story takes
place in Paris, at Athens and the Bay of Nauplia in Greece, at Weymouth
in Dorsetshire, the French battle-front, and finally in London. These
are the main divisions into which the tale naturally falls.</p>

<p>This is not a story without a plot. The action is continuous and
intense throughout, and from first to last is as inevitable as a Greek
tragedy. “When the Wicked Man …” is written with an economy
and precision of effect that is stereoscopic. The people, places, and
dramatic situations stand out from the page. They have perspective;
one sees them.</p>

<p>In fact, the novel is quite unlike anything published in England for
very many years.</p>

<p class="book">Redwing</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">By CONSTANCE SMEDLEY</span></p>

<p>Miss Smedley’s latest novel displays her usual skill in the presentation
of character; and her characters do not stand still, but grow as we
watch them. Her two leading characters in this book are a boy and girl,
both of whom are lonely, misunderstood, and, to some extent, unwanted;
and in each case the experiences of childhood create a determining bias.
Their development of strength and courage not only helps them mutually,
but finally brings the three people who are the dominating influences of
their lives into happier conditions. The book is planned on a large
scale, covers a wide range of social life, and deals with explorers,
business gamblers, and men and women of large ambitions.</p>

<p class="book">Families Repaired</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">By J. S. FLETCHER</span></p>

<p>Mr. J. S. Fletcher’s new novel is of the same <i>genre</i> as the author’s
well-known humorous stories, “The Paths of the Prudent” and “Grand
Relations,” both of which have gone through several editions. It deals
with a highly complicated matrimonial arrangement, proposed by an
Anglo-Canadian multi-millionaire as the means of repairing the fortunes
of two noble families which have fallen upon bad times, and the plot
involves numerous amusing and piquant situations and quaint embarrassments.
The various characters are drawn with great fidelity, especially
those of an old bachelor about town, a couple of young ladies of high
rank, who live their own very modernized lives in a Camden Town flat,
and an Irish-American widow of a lively and original type. The story
is full of smart and bright dialogue, and though it is essentially one of
farcical humour, the plot is exciting and even sensational.</p>

<p class="book">The Farm Servant</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">By E. H. ANSTRUTHER</span></p>

<p>The central theme of this remarkable first novel is the passionate love-story
of Anna Murrell, “The Farm Servant.” But the study of Frank
Harding and the manner in which his life was affected by three women
is of equal importance. Few modern novels have been so varied in
setting, for the two largest sections of the book deal with a quiet village
in East Anglia and with the Latin Quarter of Paris just before the War.
It is a book with passages of great tragic power; but these are interspersed
with chapters delightful for their quiet humour and acute observations
of the little “actions and reactions” of everyday life. It is a
long book: but only in a long book could the author, besides working
out the main theme, have created such a host of minor characters.
Mr. Harding, the Carringtons, the Juleses, Dr. Emmersley, Lucie Dubels,
and a dozen others are all as real as the people one meets every day.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">By GEORGE A. CHAMBERLAIN</span></p>

<p class="center smaller">Author of “Through Stained Glass,” “Home,” etc.</p>

<p>Another brilliant, fascinating, out-of-the-ordinary Chamberlain novel.
The panoramic setting is Europe, America, Africa, and the seas between.
The style is the author’s swiftest, that whirls the reader along. And
John Bogardus’s love-story, or series of love-stories, is a beautiful, tender,
and extraordinarily illuminating record. Behind the rushing style, the
astonishing fire of epigrams, the groups of memorable characters, and
the stream of the alluring plot, the reader is gratefully conscious of a
deep and rich background of seeing and thinking and feeling.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
